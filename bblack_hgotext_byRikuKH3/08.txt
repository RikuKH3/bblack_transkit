April 27 - Morning

[MSG$0007D6,18]
Imari "Wake up..."

[MSG$000802,25]
Imari "Rise and shine..."

[MSG$000835,23]
Imari "Hey, wake up..."

[MSG$000866,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$00090C,15]
Minase "Unn..."

[MSG$000935,29]
Imari "Hey, wake up already."

[MSG$00096C,8]
Slaps...

[MSG$000981,63]
Imari keeps slapping me on the cheek with the palm of her hand.

[MSG$0009C5,66]
She thinks she's slapping me lightly, but it really, really hurts.

[MSG$000A14,19]
Minase "Uu...au..."

[MSG$000A41,11]
Slapping...

[MSG$000A59,21]
Removes bed sheets...

[MSG$000B1A,20]
Minase "Cut it out!"

[MSG$000B48,37]
I yell at Imari, pulling up my futon.

[MSG$000B7A,25]
Imari "Ah, you're awake."

[MSG$000BAD,85]
I put my hand on my cheek, and it feels very hot thanks to Imari's constant slapping.

[MSG$000C07,47]
I put on my slippers and keep rubbing my cheek.

[MSG$000C43,73]
Imari "You should try to be more energetic at the beginning of the week."

[MSG$000CA6,36]
Imari lectures me as I'm dozing off.

[MSG$000CD7,101]
Minase "Sunday is the start of a new week. Which means today is actually the second day of the week."

[MSG$000D56,32]
Imari "You and your quibbles..."

[MSG$000D90,74]
I listen to Imari's lecture, and try to wake myself up by shaking my head.

[MSG$000DDF,26]
Oh, my head feels heavy...

[MSG$000E06,80]
As my head becomes clear, I slowly start to remember what happened last night...

[MSG$000E63,101]
Then the terrible visions fill my head. That's right...I did it with Yukiko last night on this bed...

[MSG$000ED5,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$000EED,59]
I wonder if my sister remembers anything from last night...

[MSG$000F35,59]
Minase "Hey, did my sister seem weird to you this morning?"

[MSG$000F8A,60]
Imari "What? Yukiko? Not really...She's the same as always."

[MSG$000FE0,60]
Imari "Don't worry, there's nobody weirder than you, Minase.

[MSG$001036,21]
Is that a compliment?

[MSG$001058,81]
Imari "Anyway, Yukiko's still here. Why don't you go see her with your own eyes?"

[MSG$0010C3,34]
I guess she hasn't gone out yet...

[MSG$0010F2,40]
Imari "Hey, stop talking and get ready."

[MSG$001134,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$0011F4,46]
Imari pressed me, so I got dressed in a hurry.

[MSG$001227,44]
I saw my sister when I got into the hallway.

[MSG$0012FF,22]
Yukiko "Good morning."

[MSG$00132F,24]
Minase "Good morning..."

[MSG$001361,50]
My sister is acting as if nothing happened at all.

[MSG$001398,79]
I guess what Ms. Takashiro said is true. Her memories of last night are gone...

[MSG$0013F4,51]
Yukiko "What's wrong? You have a creepy dark look."

[MSG$001441,17]
Minase "Nothing."

[MSG$00146C,73]
Yukiko "I'm sorry you have to deal with this idiot every morning, Imari."

[MSG$0014CF,33]
Imari "No, don't worry about it."

[MSG$00150A,21]
Minase "Ok, I'm out."

[MSG$001539,25]
Yukiko "Have a nice day."

[MSG$0015FD,52]
Imari and I left the house as my sister sent us off.

[MSG$00163E,49]
Yukiko seemed no different than any other time...

[MSG$001674,23]
I was a bit relieved...

[MSG$001698,31]
April 27 - Front gate of school

[MSG$00173E,75]
Imari and I enter the school through the front gate just as we always do. *

[MSG$001810,67]
It's the same scenery as always...But that's just on the outside...

[MSG$001860,38]
This school is filled with evil power.

[MSG$00188B,59]
And I can feel as if I'm being sucked toward the dark side.

[MSG$0018D3,88]
I try to escape from it, but the more I struggle to be free, the more I get sucked in...

[MSG$001930,50]
I wonder if I can ever lead a normal life again...

[MSG$00196F,55]
If I had a choice, I wouldn't come back to this school.

[MSG$0019AB,62]
But I know I can't accomplish anything if I keep running away.

[MSG$0019F6,82]
If I can't free myself from that book, I'll never be able to live a normal life...

[MSG$001AEF,60]
As I was changing my shoes, I saw the silhouette of someone.

[MSG$001B6A,13]
Minase "Hmm?"

[MSG$001B91,54]
I spotted Mika Ito's figure in the corner of my eye...

[MSG$001BF8,15]
Minase "Ito..."

[MSG$001C53,29]
Imari "Wha...what about Ito?"

[MSG$001C8A,49]
Imari seemed concerned after hearing what I said.

[MSG$001CC8,44]
Minase "A..yeah. Ito just went by, I think."

[MSG$001D0E,105]
Imari "Wha? Maybe you mistook someone else for her. Ito hasn't shown up at school ever since that day..."

[MSG$001D91,36]
Imari "She seemed really shocked..."

[MSG$001DCF,43]
Then I remembered what happened that day...

[MSG$001E07,44]
It was the first time I had used the book...

[MSG$001E38,74]
Now that I think about it, I haven't even considered Ito since that day...

[MSG$001E8F,22]
Imari "Hey, let's go."

[MSG$001EBF,20]
Minase "Uh, yeah..."

[MSG$001F11,9]
Mistaken?

[MSG$001F1F,69]
No, I didn't mistake someone else for Ito. That was definitely Ito...

[MSG$001F71,80]
But why is Ito here?  Since that day, she hasn't shown up to school even once...

[MSG$001FCE,37]
I immediately checked the shoe shelf,

[MSG$001FF8,101]
but it was just the same as yesterday, with her pair of slippers still inside...She hadn't been here.

[MSG$002062,35]
Maybe it was just my imagination...

[MSG$00210E,45]
I pass by Ms. Takashiro on my way to class...

[MSG$00217A,22]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$0021AA,25]
Takashiro "Good morning."

[MSG$0021DD,53]
Takashiro "Ah, I have something to give you, Minase."

[MSG$00222C,62]
Ms. Takashiro hands over a small folded paper from her pocket.

[MSG$002277,47]
While handing it over, she winks at me lightly.

[MSG$0022AB,65]
I stuff the paper into my pocket and head towards my first class.

[MSG$0022F9,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$00238C,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0023AA,39]
There's no sign of Saeki in the room...

[MSG$0023D6,19]
She's not here yet?

[MSG$0023F6,61]
I sit at my chair and read the memo I got from Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$002438,21]
This is what it said:

[MSG$00245A,65]
''During lunch time, I want you to bring Saeki behind the school.

[MSG$0024A3,49]
If I go with you, she'll suspect my intensions.''

[MSG$0024DC,11]
- Takashiro

[MSG$0024F4,24]
I have to bring Saeki...

[MSG$002511,80]
But if she doesn't come to class today, then I can't bring her to Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00256E,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0025BE,14]
Saeki appears.

[MSG$0025D1,67]
She takes a seat at her desk with the same sinister look as always.

[MSG$002656,17]
The bell rings...

[MSG$002674,35]
The bell rings, and class begins...

[MSG$002728,39]

[MSG$0027DE,21]
April 27 - Lunch time

[MSG$00288B,17]
The bell rings...

[MSG$0028A9,57]
I tried to head towards Saeki's desk as the bell sounded.

[MSG$0028EF,7]
Grab...

[MSG$002903,13]
Minase "Gah."

[MSG$00292A,87]
My body bent backwards.  Someone grabbed the scruff of my neck as I was walking foward.

[MSG$0029C1,24]
Imari "Let's eat lunch."

[MSG$0029F3,13]
It was Imari.

[MSG$002A0D,76]
Minase "I have some business to deal with, so just start eating without me."

[MSG$002A73,30]
Imari "What kind of business?"

[MSG$002AAB,90]
I look at Saeki's direction while talking to Imari.  She's about to head towards the hall.

[MSG$002B0A,32]
If I don't hurry, I'll lose her.

[MSG$002B37,48]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro asked me to do something."

[MSG$002B81,70]
Imari "Uuu...Aren't you a bit too friendly with Ms. Takashiro lately?"

[MSG$002BE1,39]
Minase "Whatever. Okay, I'm going now."

[MSG$002C46,72]
I get out of Imari's sight, and head towards the hall to look for Saeki.

[MSG$002C9B,18]
April 27 - Hallway

[MSG$002D34,16]
Minase "Shit..."

[MSG$002D5E,35]
There is no sign of Saeki anywhere.

[MSG$002D86,39]
I lost sight of her since I was slow...

[MSG$002DDE,17]
Voice "Minase..."

[MSG$002E09,41]
I heard someone call my name from behind.

[MSG$002E3F,22]
I quickly turn around.

[MSG$002E94,15]
Minase "Ito..."

[MSG$002EBD,18]
It was Mika Ito...

[MSG$002ED4,28]
So she WAS here at school...

[MSG$002EFD,36]
Ito "Minase...Can you come with me?"

[MSG$002F3B,34]
Ito has no expression on her face.

[MSG$002F62,90]
I didn't see her usual strong-minded stance, and she was staring at me with a cold look...

[MSG$002FC9,54]
Minase "I'm kind of in a hurry. Can we do this later?"

[MSG$003019,52]
I was worried about Ito, but I needed to find Saeki.

[MSG$00305A,47]
Ito "I have something important to tell you..."

[MSG$0030A3,54]
Minase "I have some important stuff to deal with too."

[MSG$003125,57]
Ito "How could you say that? After what you did to me..."

[MSG$003178,8]
......!!

[MSG$00318D,22]
What did she just say?

[MSG$0031A8,62]
Does she know that I was responsible for what happened to her?

[MSG$0031F3,58]
She looked at me with lifeless eyes, and smiled strangely.

[MSG$00323A,22]
Minase "Okay. Fine..."

[MSG$00326A,81]
I was caught off guard because of Ito's comments, and totally forgot about Saeki.

[MSG$0032C8,58]
If Ito knows about that incident, then I'm in big trouble.

[MSG$003307,41]
And also, how do I explain it all to Ito?

[MSG$00333D,23]
Ito "Okay, let's go..."

[MSG$0033FF,13]
I follow Ito.

[MSG$003419,65]
Ito goes up the stairs and opens the door that leads to the roof.

[MSG$003467,15]
April 27 - Roof

[MSG$0034F5,48]
Ito and I confront each other on the windy roof.

[MSG$003564,49]
Minase "And what is it that you want to tell me?"

[MSG$0035AF,49]
I ask Ito, even though I'm kind of feeling upset.

[MSG$0035ED,62]
Ito "Hehehe...You probably know what I'm about to say, right?"

[MSG$003645,36]
Minase "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$003683,42]
Ito "Stop pretending that you don't know."

[MSG$0036C7,39]
Her attitude...and the way she talks...

[MSG$0036F3,52]
Ito definitely knows about my part in that incident!

[MSG$003734,61]
Ito "Hehehe...Because of you, I was embarrassed like hell..."

[MSG$00378B,77]
Ito "Can you imagine how mortified I was to be in front of all those people?"

[MSG$0037F2,13]
Minase "...."

[MSG$00380C,65]
Ito smiles strangely as if she's talking about some other person.

[MSG$00385A,55]
Ito "After it happened, I even contemplated suicide..."

[MSG$0038AB,29]
Ito "But it's weird isn't it?

[MSG$0038CD,63]
A perfectly normal student suddenly acts crazy during class..."

[MSG$003926,55]
Ito "It was as if I was being controlled by someone..."

[MSG$003977,13]
Minase "...."

[MSG$003991,42]
Ito "The psychiatrist said I was neurotic.

[MSG$0039C0,32]
But I knew it wasn't like that."

[MSG$0039FA,32]
Ito "And then someone told me...

[MSG$003A1F,63]
just exactly who was responsible for making me act that way..."

[MSG$003A78,22]
Minase "Who told you?"

[MSG$003AA8,57]
Ito ignores what I have to say, and slowly approaches me.

[MSG$003AEE,54]
Ito "Then, I was given an opportunity to get revenge."

[MSG$003B3E,29]
Minase "What are you saying?"

[MSG$003B75,38]
I step backwards to get away from Ito.

[MSG$003BA8,37]
Ito "Minase...I won't forgive you..."

[MSG$003BE7,58]
Ito "I can't forgive you...and I just want to kill you..."

[MSG$003C3B,13]
Minase "Wha?"

[MSG$003C62,53]
Ito "But I'm not going to kill you just like that..."

[MSG$003CB1,56]
Ito "I'm going to drive you insane, like you did to me."

[MSG$003D03,52]
Minase "Will you just listen to what I have to say?"

[MSG$003D51,97]
Ito "You were probably having fun watching me perform...You didn't even care about how I felt..."

[MSG$003DCC,25]
Minase "That's not true!"

[MSG$003DFF,66]
Minase "I didn't know at the time that it was gonna be like that!"

[MSG$003E5B,73]
I tried to make up some excuse. To tell you the truth, it's all my fault.

[MSG$003EA9,48]
I shouldn't have fooled around with that book...

[MSG$003EE6,44]
Ito "Too late for apologies. You hypocrite!"

[MSG$003F2C,41]
It's no use. Ito won't even listen to me.

[MSG$003F62,19]
I have to escape...

[MSG$003F7A,68]
She's acting way too strange. If she has the same powers as Saeki...

[MSG$003FCB,47]
But now I realize it's too late to do anything.

[MSG$003FFF,43]
I want to escape, but my legs won't move...

[MSG$00402F,57]
As I look into Ito's eyes, I feel like I'm under a spell.

[MSG$004075,48]
Ito "What's wrong? Why don't you try to escape?"

[MSG$0040BF,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$0040E7,17]
Ito "You can't...

[MSG$0040FD,68]
You're just like a bug caught in a spider's web. There's no escape."

[MSG$00415B,14]
It can't be...

[MSG$004176,60]
Ito "Let's not waste our lunch break. Shall we get started?"

[MSG$0041CC,17]
Minase "Stop it!"

[MSG$0041F7,72]
I feel a great force of fear radiating from Ito standing in front of me.

[MSG$004244,16]
She's serious...

[MSG$004261,51]
But no one will help me. I have no means of escape.

[MSG$004299,101]
Ms. Takashiro is probably waiting for me behind the school right now...Believing that I'll show up...

[MSG$00430B,57]
Ito "Hey, lie down...I'll make you feel good real soon...

[MSG$004349,27]
Just like you did to me..."

[MSG$00440F,84]
No...I feel like it's not really my body, since it doesn't move when I tell it to...

[MSG$004468,69]
It feels like I'm hypnotized.  I do what Ito says and lie on my back.

[MSG$0044BA,74]
Ito rubs my crotch, pulls down my pants and underwear, and grabs my penis.

[MSG$00458D,38]
Ito "Hehehe...what are you expecting?"

[MSG$0045CD,55]
My cock was getting hard even in a situation like this.

[MSG$004611,74]
Ito "It's sad. Even if you're yelled at and trapped, your cock is erect...

[MSG$004660,37]
You must be a masochist. Hahahaha..."

[MSG$00469F,81]
Ito "You're pathetic. This world will be a better place without people like you."

[MSG$00470A,56]
Ito takes out a small hypodermic needle from her pocket.

[MSG$004747,44]
There's a greenish liquid inside the needle.

[MSG$004780,40]
She holds the needle up so I can see it,

[MSG$0047AD,66]
removes the cap on the needle and places her thumb on the plunger.

[MSG$0047FC,117]
Ito "This is a special drug made just for you. All you have to do is come once, and it'll send you to the afterlife."

[MSG$00488B,30]
Ito "Very exciting, isn't it?"

[MSG$0048C3,17]
Minase "Stop it."

[MSG$0048EE,75]
Ito ignores me and places the needle up against my cock without hesitation.

[MSG$004946,51]
Ito "Are you ready? I'll send you off to heaven..."

[MSG$004993,82]
Ito places the needle's point on my testicles, and pushes it in with sudden force.

[MSG$004A6B,7]
Stab...

[MSG$004A7F,16]
Minase "Arrrgh!"

[MSG$004AA9,97]
I was used to getting a needle in the arm, but it was my first time getting one in the testicles.

[MSG$004B0F,26]
I try to hold in the pain.

[MSG$004B36,81]
to pushes the needle inside and releases the greenish liquid into my testicles...

[MSG$004B94,15]
Ito "All done."

[MSG$004BBD,52]
Ito pulls out the needle after releasing the liquid.

[MSG$004C76,21]
Minase "Hah..hahhh.."

[MSG$004CA5,102]
I was out of my mind, my bloated testicles giving me the strong feeling of an approaching ejaculation.

[MSG$004D10,48]
It feels like my testicles are about to explode.

[MSG$004D4D,70]
Ito "It's amazing isn't it? How does it feel to take it in the balls?"

[MSG$004DAD,27]
Ito starts rubbing my cock.

[MSG$004DD5,31]
Minase "No, I'm about to come."

[MSG$004E0E,103]
Ito "What, are you kidding me? You're gonna be dead after this, so you have to hold it in much longer."

[MSG$004E8F,74]
Ito then reaches into her jacket and takes out a q-tip from a small pouch.

[MSG$004EDE,48]
She places the q-tip against the top of my cock.

[MSG$004F1B,28]
Minase "What are you doing?"

[MSG$004F51,44]
Ito "I'm trying to prevent you from coming."

[MSG$005014,34]
She inserts Q-tip into his cock...

[MSG$005043,15]
Minase "Hargh!"

[MSG$00506C,32]
Q-tip went deep inside my penis.

[MSG$005091,76]
It goes down my urethra, and I hold back the pain and the feeling of climax.

[MSG$0050EA,103]
Ito "Since it's your last time, I'll give you something special. It'd be too sad to just use my hands."

[MSG$0051FC,48]
Ito takes off her clothes and gets on top of me.

[MSG$005239,63]
Ito "It's kind of exciting to do it on the roof of the school."

[MSG$005292,26]
Ito "Here it goes...nnnn!"

[MSG$005342,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$00535B,20]
Ito lowers her hips,

[MSG$005374,33]
my erect penis enters her vagina.

[MSG$0053A2,55]
Ito "So big...Wow, it's getting even bigger inside me."

[MSG$0053F3,80]
My cock is inside her vagina, and she starts moving her hips slowly up and down.

[MSG$005450,10]
Banging...

[MSG$005467,31]
Minase "If you go like that..."

[MSG$0054A0,42]
Ito "You're gonna come? Do it if you can."

[MSG$0054E4,59]
I too, start to move my hips, thrusting in order to climax.

[MSG$00552C,20]
Minase "I'm coming!"

[MSG$00555A,78]
But no matter how hard I try, the feeling of climax goes away after a while...

[MSG$0055AD,38]
And then the feeling comes back again.

[MSG$0055E0,68]
My head becomes numb with feeling of ejaculation coming and going...

[MSG$005629,43]
I really don't care what happens anymore...

[MSG$005661,36]
Ito "Well? Feels great, doesn't it?"

[MSG$00569F,18]
Minase "Uh..uuu.."

[MSG$0056CB,63]
Ito was looking at me in my miserable state.  She was giggling.

[MSG$005717,71]
Ito "That reminds me...you masturbated while watching me sleep, right?"

[MSG$005778,27]
I can't believe she knew...

[MSG$005798,63]
But right now, I don't have time to be ashamed of what I did...

[MSG$0057E4,64]
Ito "It was very difficult to wipe off all that thick liquid..."

[MSG$00583E,29]
Minase "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$005875,103]
I try to hold back all the pleasure I'm getting, and I'm listening to her ridicule me at the same time.

[MSG$0058E1,39]
I'm gonna go insane if this keeps up...

[MSG$005915,57]
Ito "Well, did you get excited looking at my naked body?"

[MSG$005968,84]
Ito keeps thrusting down with her hips, questioning me as I struggle underneath her.

[MSG$0059C9,39]
Ito "I mean really. Does it feel good?"

[MSG$005A0A,23]
Minase "It feels good."

[MSG$005A3B,111]
Ito "You're very honest. Since I'm letting you do me, you better shoot out twice the cock butter as last time."

[MSG$005AC4,46]
Minase "Let me come...I'm about to explode..."

[MSG$005B0C,51]
Ito "You're so weak. You really want to ejaculate?"

[MSG$005B59,42]
No...If I say yes, I lose automatically...

[MSG$005B88,70]
But I'm about to say the exact opposite of what my mind is thinking...

[MSG$005BDB,24]
I'm way past my limit...

[MSG$005C00,26]
Minase "I want to come..."

[MSG$005C34,47]
Ito "Hehehe...Okay, I guess I'll let you come."

[MSG$005CFA,52]
Ito pulls my penis out, and starts stroking it hard.

[MSG$005D3B,61]
Ito "It's so big...I'll make you feel comfortable very soon."

[MSG$005D92,54]
Ito "But you'll feel so good you might die. Hehehe..."

[MSG$005DE2,34]
Ito "I'm pulling out the q-tip..."

[MSG$005E1E,57]
Ito holds the tip of the q-tip and slowly pulls it out...

[MSG$005E64,24]
Pulling the q-tip out...

[MSG$005E89,16]
Ito "Now, come!"

[MSG$005F3C,22]
The Q-tip comes out...

[MSG$005F5F,27]
Minase "Ah..ah..I can't..."

[MSG$006086,14]
Ejaculating...

[MSG$0060A1,75]
When the q-tip is pulled out, streams of white semen shot out from the tip.

[MSG$0060F1,110]
The amount and force of the ejaculation was almost like pissing, and I was overcome by the waves of my orgasm.

[MSG$00616C,18]
Cum pouring out...

[MSG$00618B,88]
Ito "Ahahaha, so much for twice the cock butter. This is more like three or four times."

[MSG$0061FD,91]
I bask in the ejaculation until I'm about to faint, and keep on shooting out my cock juice.

[MSG$0062DE,20]
Juice pouring out...

[MSG$0062FF,59]
The juice keeps pouring onto Ito, and it covers her all up.

[MSG$006347,37]
Ito "Ah, so dirty. It's so sticky..."

[MSG$006386,49]
Something's not right...I can't stop ejaculating!

[MSG$0063BC,55]
Cum keeps pouring out from my penis. It's unbelievable.

[MSG$006400,76]
It doesn't seem to slow down at all, and I keep on ejaculating like crazy.

[MSG$006459,63]
It's because of that drug...But I can't do anything about it...

[MSG$0064A5,19]
Minase "Help me..."

[MSG$0064D2,81]
Ito "It's too late. You know, you should feel lucky to be able to die like this."

[MSG$00653D,24]
Minase "What...ah..aah!"

[MSG$00656F,53]
Ito "Hehehehehehe...how ridiculous. You're pathetic."

[MSG$0065BE,98]
She looks at me like I'm the most pitiful thing she's ever seen.  She dresses herself and gets up.

[MSG$0066CE,60]
Ito "Bye bye. If you're lucky, maybe someone will help you."

[MSG$006724,87]
Ito "But you're gonna keep on ejaculating until you die...Die in the arms of pleasure."

[MSG$006795,20]
Minase "Wait! Uurh!"

[MSG$0067C3,71]
Ito "Well, I should get going. Lunch break will be over soon. Bye bye."

[MSG$006848,80]
Ito goes away, leaving me alone in the center of the roof ejaculating in vain...

[MSG$0068A5,56]
The door to the roof slams shut, and I'm left all alone.

[MSG$006963,57]
I look up at the sky with my consciousness fading away...

[MSG$0069A1,63]
A gloomy sky...I guess it's perfect for my current situation...

[MSG$0069ED,73]
I hear the sound of the bell to signal the beginning of the next class...

[MSG$006A43,42]
It sounds like a bell of requiem for me...

[MSG$006A9A,25]
Ending No. 6 ''Mika Ito''

[MSG$006AB8,10]
...Bad End

[MSG$006AF9,23]
I have to find Saeki...

[MSG$006D2B,49]
I searched around the floor that my class was on.

[MSG$006D69,58]
I look in the bathrooms and other classrooms as I walk by.

[MSG$006DA8,36]
But I don't see any sign of Saeki...

[MSG$006DD9,29]
Where did she go...damn it...

[MSG$006E03,91]
If she used another staircase, then it's possible I may have missed her by just a second...

[MSG$006FA8,42]
I go to the 1st floor and look everywhere.

[MSG$006FDF,29]
But I see no sign of Saeki...

[MSG$007009,82]
Her shoes are still on the shoe shelves, so I don't think she left the building...

[MSG$007068,17]
She's not here...

[MSG$0071C3,42]
I go to the 2nd floor and look everywhere.

[MSG$0071FA,29]
But I see no sign of Saeki...

[MSG$007224,17]
She's not here...

[MSG$00736B,43]
I climbed up the stairs to get to the roof.

[MSG$0073A3,106]
At this time of year, no one really comes up here. Only scraps of trash can be seen blowing in the wind...

[MSG$00741A,17]
She's not here...

[MSG$007553,43]
I go down to the 1st floor and look around.

[MSG$00758B,29]
But I see no sign of Saeki...

[MSG$0075B5,32]
Saeki "You looking for someone?"

[MSG$0075EF,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$007614,65]
I turn around, surprised to hear a familiar voice from behind me.

[MSG$007694,38]
Saeki "Hahaha...don't be so surprised.

[MSG$0076BF,35]
I'm not gonna eat you or anything."

[MSG$0076FC,26]
Saeki is grinning at me...

[MSG$00771B,24]
Where did she come from?

[MSG$007740,71]
Minase "I was just looking for you. Can you come with me for a second?"

[MSG$0077A1,70]
I pretend to sound calm as I ask her. I try not to look into her eyes.

[MSG$0077EC,48]
Honestly, I really don't want to see her face...

[MSG$007829,33]
Saeki "What do you want from me?"

[MSG$007864,62]
Minase "Come with me and you'll find out. It won't take long."

[MSG$0078BC,35]
I keep my eyes averted as I talk...

[MSG$0078EC,83]
Saeki listens, and it looks like she's thinking it over as she stares hard at me...

[MSG$007944,71]
Her eyes seem to see right through me, and a shiver runs down my spine.

[MSG$007998,49]
After a moment of silence, Saeki opens her mouth.

[MSG$0079D6,37]
Saeki "All right...I'll go with you."

[MSG$007A15,37]
I sigh with relief after she says it.

[MSG$007A3F,66]
If she refused to come with me, then I know I'd be pretty screwed.

[MSG$007A8E,37]
Saeki "Are we going or not? Come on."

[MSG$007ACD,62]
I try to hold down the feeling of panic, and show her the way.

[MSG$007B18,25]
April 27 - Back of school

[MSG$007BBC,54]
I took Saeki around behind the main school building...

[MSG$007BF7,33]
Of course, there's nobody around.

[MSG$007C57,87]
Saeki "What are you trying to do, Minase? Why did you bring me to a place like this..."

[MSG$007CC8,31]
Saeki's voice seemed very calm.

[MSG$007CF4,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$007D0D,54]
Saeki "You brought me here but you can't tell me why?"

[MSG$007D5D,70]
I'm listening to what Saeki's saying, but I'm keeping quiet as I walk.

[MSG$007DA8,60]
Then we reach a secluded area and I suddenly come to a stop.

[MSG$007DF1,87]
Saeki "This is it? Did you take me out here so you can try and do something perverted?"

[MSG$007E62,52]
Saeki stares at me with a strange smile on her face.

[MSG$007E9B,65]
I don't like her eyes...I can't figure out what she's thinking...

[MSG$007EE9,44]
I wait quietly for Ms. Takashiro to show up.

[MSG$007F22,12]
Footsteps...

[MSG$007F3B,37]
Then I hear footsteps approaching us.

[MSG$007FCB,51]
Saeki "Ahh, so you're accompanied by a guardian..."

[MSG$008018,41]
Saeki's lips twist a bit as she looks on.

[MSG$00804E,52]
Takashiro "I was the one who called you out, Saeki."

[MSG$00809D,64]
Ms. Takashiro is standing in front of Saeki and talking quietly.

[MSG$0080E2,28]
Her eyes are fixed on Saeki.

[MSG$00810B,51]
Takashiro "You know why I called you out, correct?"

[MSG$008159,59]
Saeki "No. Did I do something to upset you, Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$0081AE,53]
Saeki said it without changing her expression at all.

[MSG$0081F0,25]
Takashiro "Yes, you did."

[MSG$008224,57]
Saeki "Well, I don't really recall doing anything bad..."

[MSG$008277,64]
Takashiro "I'll get right to the point. Give me back that book."

[MSG$0082D1,44]
Ms. Takashiro is confronting Saeki directly.

[MSG$00830A,113]
I'm looking at them from the sidelines, and I'm very worried. If Saeki uses her powers, it's gonna be a disaster.

[MSG$008380,105]
It's not that I don't trust Ms. Takashiro, it's just that I'll be helpless if something starts to happen.

[MSG$00844C,41]
Saeki "Heh heh...you're very aggressive."

[MSG$00848F,39]
Saeki "Why do I have to listen to you?"

[MSG$0084D0,83]
Takashiro "Do you know what that book is? That power should not be used by humans."

[MSG$00853D,77]
Takashiro "If you get yourself involved with that book, you will surely die."

[MSG$0085A4,25]
Saeki "What if I say no?"

[MSG$0085D7,41]
Takashiro "Then I'll take it by force..."

[MSG$00861A,56]
Saeki "Interesting. Why don't you show what you can do?"

[MSG$00866C,38]
Saeki fixes her eyes on Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00869F,38]
No... Saeki is gonna use her powers...

[MSG$0086CA,101]
A discomforting air spreads out from Saeki...It's the kind of bad air that makes your spin knot up...

[MSG$0087B8,45]
Saeki "Je suis Lucife. J'ai beaucoup de nom."

[MSG$0087FF,81]
Saeki's lips start moving, as she recites some spell.  I have no idea what it is.

[MSG$00885D,25]
Takashiro "ZAH...ONDOH...

[MSG$00887B,19]
MIH...BUZD...PAID."

[MSG$0088A8,55]
Then Ms. Takashiro starts to recite a spell of her own.

[MSG$0088EC,54]
Saeki "Alpha Et Omega. Acolib Agla Amaimon. Belzebub!"

[MSG$008927,14]
Bamurei Beimon

[MSG$00894F,50]
Takashiro "IKZHIKAL..EDLPRNAA..BATAIVAH..RAAGIOSL.

[MSG$008986,66]
Behold the four flaming pentagrams as I stand alone in the midst!"

[MSG$008AC6,84]
They both finish chanting at about the same time, and a light shimmers between them.

[MSG$008B1F,42]
And then it bursts before them, exploding.

[MSG$008B56,60]
Saeki didn't seem surprised by Ms. Takashiro's power at all.

[MSG$008B97,100]
I really don't know what happened. But one thing is certain. Ms. Takashiro nullified Saeki's attack.

[MSG$008C80,28]
Saeki "The power of Enoch!?"

[MSG$008CB6,64]
Takashiro "You can't break my barrier with your level of skill."

[MSG$008D10,110]
Saeki and Ms. Takashiro were standing inside a repelling field, some kind of equilibrium between their powers.

[MSG$008D83,58]
I can't see it with my eyes, but you can sense its energy.

[MSG$008DCA,57]
All I can do is watch...Their powers are way greater than

[MSG$008E08,33]
what I got from that that book...

[MSG$008E36,87]
Saeki "Grrr...All right, I'll let you go for now. But it won't be this easy next time."

[MSG$008EA7,39]
Saeki suddenly turns around and leaves.

[MSG$008F82,24]
Takashiro "Hah..hahhh.."

[MSG$008FB4,49]
Ms. Takashiro is standing, but breathing heavily.

[MSG$008FEA,49]
After Saeki disappeared, she drops her shoulders.

[MSG$009028,27]
Minase "Are you all right?"

[MSG$00905D,49]
Takashiro "Don't worry...I'm just a bit tired..."

[MSG$0090A8,84]
Takashiro "I underestimated Saeki's powers. That power is not just from the book..."

[MSG$009116,26]
Minase "What do you mean?"

[MSG$00914A,88]
Takashiro "She was connected to an evil force directly. It actually isn't that powerful,

[MSG$0091A7,46]
but it's not something you can do normally..."

[MSG$0091EF,58]
I knew something was strange when I saw her powers before.

[MSG$00922E,57]
So she has gained some Black Magic other than the book...

[MSG$009274,96]
Nothing happened this time, but from the looks of Ms. Takashiro, she can't defeat Saeki's power.

[MSG$0092D9,33]
She can only defend against it...

[MSG$009307,80]
Takashiro "This is becoming problematic. She might be difficult to deal with..."

[MSG$009371,70]
Takashiro "But since the battle has begun, there's no way out of this.

[MSG$0093BC,44]
I think it's better to prepare ourselves..."

[MSG$009402,77]
Geez, that's discouraging...But Ms. Takashiro is the only person I can trust.

[MSG$009454,52]
It's not the kind of thing I can deal with myself...

[MSG$009495,88]
Takashiro "I'd like to try and think of a plan, but I'm afraid we don't have much time."

[MSG$009507,87]
Takashiro "After seeing that kind of power, taking back the book back won't be enough."

[MSG$009563,64]
If I don't take care of her, she'll become even more powerful...

[MSG$0095BD,84]
Takashiro "It's better to stop her early. The more time we waste, the worse it gets.

[MSG$009616,96]
If she gets any stronger, I won't be able to stop her. We have to do it before it's too late..."

[MSG$009690,106]
Takashiro "If they summon the evil forces like they did 12 years ago, there will be countless atrocities."

[MSG$009714,34]
Minase "What are you going to do?"

[MSG$009751,45]
Takashiro "I'll challenge her again tonight."

[MSG$009798,90]
Takashiro "The apartment she's renting...that must be where these new powers are focused."

[MSG$00980C,82]
Takashiro "If I go there, I might be able to find out what they're trying to do...

[MSG$009863,51]
if things go well, I can put an end to all this..."

[MSG$0098B0,40]
Minase "Do you think you can beat them?"

[MSG$0098F2,27]
Takashiro "I don't know..."

[MSG$009927,16]
Minase "What..."

[MSG$009951,29]
Takashiro "But I have to try.

[MSG$009973,73]
If they are planning something, they'll do it on the night of Walpurgis."

[MSG$0099D6,64]
Takashiro "There's only 3 days until Walpurgis. There's no time.

[MSG$009A1B,79]
What are you going to do? You don't have to come with me if you don't want to."

[MSG$009ABB,87]
Minase "I'm going with you. I'm responsible for starting this mess in the first place."

[MSG$009B2C,68]
Takashiro "Are you sure? It might be more dangerous than you think."

[MSG$009B8A,59]
Minase "Yeah. It's better than staying home doing nothing."

[MSG$009BDF,82]
Takashiro "Haha! You're very brave. I hope you can help me if I get into trouble."

[MSG$009C4B,21]
Ms. Takashiro smiles.

[MSG$009C65,36]
She's the one that has to help me...

[MSG$009C96,67]
Takashiro "Stop by after school. We'll carry out the plan tonight."

[MSG$009CF3,22]
Minase "I understand."

[MSG$009D2E,33]
Minase "I don't think I'll go..."

[MSG$009D69,111]
I replied after thinking about it for a minute. I would like to go with her, but I know I can't be of any help.

[MSG$009DE5,57]
Takashiro "Smart decision. Maybe it's better this way..."

[MSG$009E38,77]
Takashiro "Well, pray that I succeed. If anything happens, I'll contact you."

[MSG$009E9F,24]
Minase "I understand..."

[MSG$009ED1,81]
Takashiro "Let's get back inside. It's almost time for your next class to start."

[MSG$009F3C,59]
Ms. Takashiro and I left and went back inside the school...

[MSG$00A00B,20]
April 27 - Afternoon

[MSG$00A0C1,70]
Imari "You're late! I was eating very slowly but I'm finished anyway."

[MSG$00A121,43]
As I return to class, I hear Imari's voice.

[MSG$00A159,53]
Minase "Sorry. It took a bit longer than I expected."

[MSG$00A1A8,52]
Imari "Urgh...It's time for our next class already."

[MSG$00A21A,25]
I take a seat at my desk.

[MSG$00A238,34]
Of course, Saeki hasn't come back.

[MSG$00A25F,64]
I was feeling hungry, so I ate my lunch secretly during class...

[MSG$00A330,30]
..............................

[MSG$00A35B,24]
........................

[MSG$00A380,15]
...............

[MSG$00A39C,12]
............

[MSG$00A3B5,6]
......

[MSG$00A45D,20]
The bell sounds...

[MSG$00A47E,58]
And finally, my boring afternoon classes come to an end...

[MSG$00A4C5,23]
April 27 - After school

[MSG$00A511,52]
Imari "Minase. You're going to the art room, right?"

[MSG$00A55F,62]
Just as always, Imari comes along right after the bell sounds.

[MSG$00A5C3,24]
Minase "Yeah, let's go."

[MSG$00A5F5,89]
Imari "Good. You're really into it now, huh? I guess it was worth coming here yesterday."

[MSG$00A668,30]
Minase "It's not like that..."

[MSG$00A6A0,68]
I think Imari has it all wrong. I'm only going to see Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00A76D,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$00A7BD,22]
Imari "Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$00A7ED,68]
Maybe we're early, since there's nobody else from the art club here.

[MSG$00A836,71]
But there is Ms. Takashiro standing right here in middle of the room...

[MSG$00A88A,38]
Ms. Takashiro and I nod to each other.

[MSG$00A8BD,59]
Takashiro "Imari. I have to go somewhere with Minase today,

[MSG$00A8FD,36]
can you look after the club for me?"

[MSG$00A992,13]
Imari "What?"

[MSG$00A9B9,22]
Takashiro "I'm sorry."

[MSG$00A9E9,34]
Imari "No, I don't mind at all..."

[MSG$00AA25,26]
Imari sounded a bit sad...

[MSG$00AA44,47]
But I can't worry about her feelings right now.

[MSG$00AA80,38]
Takashiro "Well, I'm counting on you."

[MSG$00AAC0,12]
Imari "Yes."

[MSG$00AAE6,66]
Ms. Takashiro and I left the room, leaving Imari all alone inside.

[MSG$00ABA3,60]
Classes are over...I wonder if Ms. Takashiro is all right...

[MSG$00ABEC,26]
Imari "Hey, are we going?"

[MSG$00AC20,33]
Minase "Yeah, yeah. I'm going..."

[MSG$00AC5B,49]
I replied without a second thought, and stood up.

[MSG$00AC99,47]
Maybe Ms. Takashiro is still in the art room...

[MSG$00ACCD,48]
I said I wouldn't go, but I'm kind of worried...

[MSG$00AD86,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$00ADD6,34]
Imari "We're the first ones here."

[MSG$00AE12,57]
Maybe we're here early, since nobody else is in the room.

[MSG$00AE58,62]
I try to find Ms. Takashiro, but she is nowhere to be found...

[MSG$00AE9B,25]
Maybe she already left...

[MSG$00AEC1,52]
Imari "Come on. Stop daydreaming and let's do this."

[MSG$00AF8C,43]
I take the canvas and place it on an easel.

[MSG$00AFC4,50]
Imari "It looks like we can start the color today.

[MSG$00AFFB,86]
I was a bit skeptical at first, but it looks good.  I guess it's because I helped out.

[MSG$00B056,7]
Yep..."

[MSG$00B077,35]
Imari muttered to herself and nods.

[MSG$00B0A7,62]
But I'm worried about Ms. Takashiro. I can't relax and draw...

[MSG$00B0EA,28]
I should've gone with her...

[MSG$00B113,42]
Can I still make it if I go after her now?

[MSG$00B14A,55]
Instead of just thinking, I better get my butt in gear.

[MSG$00B22D,21]
Preparing to leave...

[MSG$00B24F,33]
Imari "Hey, where are you going?"

[MSG$00B28B,43]
Minase "I remembered I gotta go somewhere."

[MSG$00B302,51]
Imari "Hey! You're making up an excuse not to draw.

[MSG$00B33A,59]
Just when I speak highly of your work, you bail out on me!"

[MSG$00B38F,37]
I ignore Imari as I prepare to leave.

[MSG$00B3C1,26]
Minase "Sorry, take care."

[MSG$00B3F5,29]
I quickly leave the art room.

[MSG$00B41F,28]
Imari "Hey, come back here!"

[MSG$00B455,37]
Imari shouts and tries to jump at me.

[MSG$00B487,10]
Dodging...

[MSG$00B49E,27]
I quickly dodge her attack.

[MSG$00B55B,6]
Crash!

[MSG$00B592,13]
Imari "Guaa!"

[MSG$00B5B9,73]
Imari gets her feet tangled up in the easel and she tumbles to the floor.

[MSG$00B60F,15]
Minase "Sorry."

[MSG$00B638,91]
I run out of the classroom after apologizing to Imari.  She's lying on the floor awkwardly.

[MSG$00B731,62]
Imari "Ugh...you're gonna abandon a girl like this...you clod!

[MSG$00B805,95]
I open the door of the staff room, looking for Ms. Takashiro...But I don't see any sign of her.

[MSG$00B869,26]
She left campus already?

[MSG$00B890,53]
I ask a professor nearby, and I'm told she just left.

[MSG$00B8D2,41]
I quickly run over to the front entrance.

[MSG$00B984,75]
I go down to the 1st floor, and luckily, I find Ms. Takashiro just in time.

[MSG$00BA0E,23]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro!"

[MSG$00BA3F,34]
Takashiro "Minase...What's wrong?"

[MSG$00BA7B,28]
Minase "I'm going with you."

[MSG$00BAB1,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$00BADC,59]
Minase "I'm just worried about letting you go on your own."

[MSG$00BB31,51]
Takashiro "Hahaha!...All right, let's go together."

[MSG$00BB7E,70]
Ms. Takashiro and I nod to each other and leave the school together...

[MSG$00BC39,20]
April 27 - Apartment

[MSG$00BCED,106]
After Ms. Takashiro and I killed some time, we ended up standing in front of Saeki's apartment building...

[MSG$00BD6A,106]
After Ms. Takashiro and I killed some time, we ended up standing in front of Saeki's apartment building...

[MSG$00BE13,26]
Takashiro "Are you ready?"

[MSG$00BE47,15]
Minase "Yes..."

[MSG$00BE70,34]
Takashiro "All right, let's go..."

[MSG$00BEAC,36]
Takashiro "Before we go, take this."

[MSG$00BEEA,57]
Ms. Takashiro takes a black-colored item from her pocket.

[MSG$00BF28,18]
It's a stun gun...

[MSG$00BF47,96]
Takashiro "In case you're in trouble, protect yourself with it. You know how to use one, right?"

[MSG$00BFC1,15]
Minase "Yes..."

[MSG$00BFEA,69]
Takashiro "I've increased the voltage, so you might feel it as well."

[MSG$00C049,76]
She gives me a leather glove just in case. I put the glove on my right hand.

[MSG$00C09A,38]
Things are getting pretty dangerous...

[MSG$00C0CD,29]
Takashiro "Okay, let's go..."

[MSG$00C180,81]
Take the elevator up to the floor Saeki's on, and keep an eye out for the room...

[MSG$00C1D6,51]
I'm getting nervous as we get closer to the room...

[MSG$00C216,58]
I have my right hand in my pocket, holding the stun gun...

[MSG$00C255,44]
I just pray that I don't have to use this...

[MSG$00C2C0,25]
Takashiro "We're here..."

[MSG$00C2F3,70]
Ms. Takashiro checks the room number, and pauses in front of the door.

[MSG$00C346,18]
Takashiro "Ready?"

[MSG$00C372,6]
I nod.

[MSG$00C385,52]
Ms. Takashiro pushes the doorbell with her finger...

[MSG$00C3C6,21]
The doorbell rings...

[MSG$00C3E8,73]
I can hear the faint sound of the bell from the other side of the door...

[MSG$00C43E,14]
It's silent...

[MSG$00C459,18]
There's no answer.

[MSG$00C478,70]
Ms. Takashiro places her hand on the door knob and turns it carefully.

[MSG$00C4CB,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$00C4E9,24]
Takashiro "It's open..."

[MSG$00C597,37]
Ms. Takashiro and I enter the room...

[MSG$00C5C1,77]
It's dark inside, and there are several pairs of shoes by the front entrance.

[MSG$00C613,28]
I know there's someone here.

[MSG$00C63C,34]
We enter the strange-looking room.

[MSG$00C66B,66]
It's dark...The only thing illuminating this room are the candles.

[MSG$00C6B2,90]
It's really hard to see with just those candles, and I'm afraid I might trip on something.

[MSG$00C719,36]
Takashiro "What an eerie feeling..."

[MSG$00C757,91]
Ms. Takashiro and I look for any sign of people as we work our way to the back of the room.

[MSG$00C7BF,82]
Voice "You're trespassing on someone else's property. You're just like a burglar."

[MSG$00C82B,39]
A voice can be heard from the darkness.

[MSG$00C85F,24]
Takashiro "Who's there?"

[MSG$00C8C4,68]
Saeki "You break into my place and ask ''who's there?'' How rude..."

[MSG$00C922,55]
Saeki appears as if she materialized from the darkness.

[MSG$00C966,28]
Takashiro "So it was you..."

[MSG$00C99C,75]
Saeki "Heh, heh...What do you want? Coming all the way over to my place..."

[MSG$00CA01,51]
Saeki "And Minase...I thought I warned you, too..."

[MSG$00CA4E,83]
Takashiro "That's what I want to ask you, Saeki. What are you doing in this place?"

[MSG$00CABB,62]
Saeki "Are you here to lecture me? Even if you're a professor,

[MSG$00CAFE,78]
I don't think you have the right to enter other people's homes as you please."

[MSG$00CB66,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$00CB8F,60]
Saeki "Of course, you must be prepared since you're here..."

[MSG$00CBE5,17]
The door locks...

[MSG$00CC03,68]
The door behind us is being locked. They even put a chain across it.

[MSG$00CC54,73]
I can see the shadows of 2 people by the door...They knew we were coming,

[MSG$00CCA2,41]
and they must've been hiding somewhere...

[MSG$00CCD0,26]
No...they outsmarted us...

[MSG$00CCF7,48]
Saeki "Well...I'll give you plenty of punishment

[MSG$00CD2C,22]
for your stupidity..."

[MSG$00CD5C,53]
Saeki "Amatsuki, Kurimoto, entertain these guests..."

[MSG$00CDAB,33]
I think we might be in trouble...

[MSG$00CDD1,77]
I grip the stun gun tight in my pocket. I still have my finger on the switch.

[MSG$00CE2B,39]
Takashiro "Stay close to me, Minase..."

[MSG$00CE6C,31]
I move closer to Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00CE90,51]
We're surrounded from both sides.  We can't escape.

[MSG$00CED0,101]
Amatsuki and Kurimoto have upside-down crosses on their chests, and they are slowly approaching us...

[MSG$00CF9B,57]
Takashiro "El Elohim...Elohi Elohei Sabaoth Elion Sadai!"

[MSG$00CFEE,67]
Saeki "She has some powers of her own. Watch out for the backlash."

[MSG$00D04B,70]
Before Saeki can warn them, they are already rushing at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00D09E,4]
Zap!

[MSG$00D1AF,15]
Kurimoto "Ugh!"

[MSG$00D1D8,17]
Amatsuki "Hurgh!"

[MSG$00D227,88]
Both Kurimoto and Amatsuki go flying back towards the wall, their powers were deflected.

[MSG$00D28C,15]
Saeki "Damn..."

[MSG$00D2E8,71]
Takashiro "I wasn't prepared last time, but this time, it's different."

[MSG$00D349,61]
Ms. Takashiro smiles as she shows off the ring on her finger.

[MSG$00D38B,53]
There's the name of a god clearly carved in the ring.

[MSG$00D3CD,59]
Saeki "Oh please, you think I'm gonna fall for that trick?"

[MSG$00D422,38]
Takashiro "You want to give it a try?"

[MSG$00D462,15]
Saeki "Damn..."

[MSG$00D48B,56]
Even though Saeki's bluffing, she slowly steps backward.

[MSG$00D503,94]
Takashiro "What are you people trying to do? I'll beat it out of you by force if I have to..."

[MSG$00D57B,41]
Voice "I'll explain everything to you..."

[MSG$00D5BE,24]
Takashiro "Who's there?"

[MSG$00D5F0,17]
Saeki "Mistress!"

[MSG$00D63F,44]
Saeki disappears quickly into the back room.

[MSG$00D678,48]
Voice "Welcome Ms. Takashiro, welcome Minase..."

[MSG$00D6C2,41]
A voice can be heard from the darkness...

[MSG$00D6F0,51]
Ms. Takashiro and I slowly follow it into the room.

[MSG$00D730,26]
April 27 - Room of rituals

[MSG$00D80D,45]
Takashiro "What is this awful-looking place?"

[MSG$00D854,95]
Just walking into the room makes my stomach tense up and hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

[MSG$00D8B8,45]
It's like that room in the school basement...

[MSG$00D8F2,88]
A magic circle is drawn on the floor, plus the entire place is decorated with candles...

[MSG$00D94F,43]
It's the perfect place for a witch to live.

[MSG$00D9DE,52]
Kitami "Thanks for coming. Welcome to my sanctuary."

[MSG$00DA2C,82]
A strange-looking woman appears from the darkness...I'm surprised to see her face.

[MSG$00DA83,13]
I know her...

[MSG$00DA9D,20]
Minase "Dr. Kitami?"

[MSG$00DACB,55]
It was Reika Kitami, a professor and the campus doctor.

[MSG$00DB0F,29]
Takashiro "Why are you here?"

[MSG$00DB46,25]
Kitami "Gee, I wonder..."

[MSG$00DB79,43]
Kitami looks at us with a peculiar smile...

[MSG$00DBA9,77]
It's her, but somehow she looks nothing like the person I've see at school...

[MSG$00DC03,18]
Who is this woman?

[MSG$00DC1A,31]
How is she related to the book?

[MSG$00DC46,55]
Takashiro "Are you the leader of Saeki's little group?"

[MSG$00DC97,22]
Kitami "What if I am?"

[MSG$00DCC7,49]
Takashiro "I don't know...I really don't know..."

[MSG$00DD12,39]
Takashiro "What are you planning to do?

[MSG$00DD3E,55]
Why do you know about the book and that basement room?"

[MSG$00DE34,44]
Takashiro "What is this awful-looking room?"

[MSG$00DE7A,95]
Ms. Takashiro and I reach an altar that is very similar to the one I saw in that basement room.

[MSG$00DEDE,88]
A magic circle is drawn on the floor, plus the entire place is decorated with candles...

[MSG$00DF3B,43]
It's the perfect place for a witch to live.

[MSG$00DFCA,52]
Kitami "Thanks for coming. Welcome to my sanctuary."

[MSG$00E018,52]
A strange-looking woman appears from the darkness...

[MSG$00E051,40]
I knew exactly who she was...Dr. Kitami.

[MSG$00E086,27]
Takashiro "Reika Kitami..."

[MSG$00E0BB,29]
Kitami "I knew you'd come..."

[MSG$00E0F2,43]
Kitami looks at us with a peculiar smile...

[MSG$00E122,77]
It's her, but somehow she looks nothing like the person I've see at school...

[MSG$00E17C,85]
Takashiro "What are you people trying to accomplish? Why are you making such a mess?"

[MSG$00E1EB,49]
Kitami "Oh, who really knows? What do you think?"

[MSG$00E236,49]
Takashiro "I don't know...I really don't know..."

[MSG$00E281,39]
Takashiro "What are you planning to do?

[MSG$00E2AD,52]
Why you know about the book and that basement room?"

[MSG$00E2FB,80]
Takashiro "I checked you out. But everything about your past has been erased..."

[MSG$00E365,57]
Takashiro "It's all connected.  The book, the basement...

[MSG$00E3A3,67]
The people who knew about the power 12 years ago have already died.

[MSG$00E3EB,40]
But you know more about this than I do."

[MSG$00E42D,70]
Kitami "Well, maybe...but my memory's not as good as it used to be..."

[MSG$00E48D,83]
Takashiro "You know everything! How are you related to the events of 12 years ago?"

[MSG$00E4FA,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$00E513,64]
Dr. Kitami says nothing, but she keeps smiling at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$00E560,85]
Takashiro "All right...If you don't want to tell me, then I'll beat it out of you..."

[MSG$00E5CF,44]
Kitami "Heh. What can you possibly do that?"

[MSG$00E615,17]
Takashiro "Damn!"

[MSG$00E640,79]
Ms. Takashiro bites her lip and glares at Dr. Kitami as she recites her spells.

[MSG$00E6F2,66]
Takashiro "Alpha Omega..Elohi Elohim Sabaoth Elion Ischiros Adonai

[MSG$00E739,27]
|Jah Tetragrammaton Sadai!"

[MSG$00E76E,8]
Crack...

[MSG$00E783,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$00E7AE,117]
Ms. Takashiro finishes reciting her spell, there's a surge of power, and the ring on her finger explodes into pieces.

[MSG$00E830,94]
Kitami "Ahahaha! It's no use. Seeking power from god or asking for help won't do you any good.

[MSG$00E893,77]
You know the Bible says, 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.'"

[MSG$00E8FA,79]
Kitami "The Seraphim's praise was suitable for the Lord in the book of Isaiah."

[MSG$00E956,24]
Takashiro "You monster!"

[MSG$00E988,102]
Ms. Takashiro assumes a defensive stance, and starts to recite the same long spell she used last time.

[MSG$00EA7E,41]
Takashiro "EXARP..BITOM..NANTA..HCOMA..."

[MSG$00EAC1,81]
Takashiro "Angels of great powers and holiness in the name of God. I summon you!"

[MSG$00EB2C,44]
Kitami "Well...summoning guardian angels..."

[MSG$00EB72,64]
Kitami is watching, very relaxed. She's giving a slight smile...

[MSG$00EBBF,98]
Takashiro "Angels that dwell in the heavens. I summon you. You protect the doors of this universe.

[MSG$00EC26,54]
You serve as the protectors of this celestial sphere."

[MSG$00EC76,102]
Takashiro "Ward off all evil and heal the imbalance of this world. Give me strength and enlightenment.

[MSG$00ECE1,65]
If not, I will expose your whereabouts to the rest of the world."

[MSG$00ED3C,117]
Takashiro "I won't consider you as a holy spirit of our celestial sphere or keep you as a secret light inside of me!"

[MSG$00EE0F,72]
Then, Ms. Takashiro's body shines and a bright angel comes flying out...

[MSG$00EE64,89]
The angel looks like a beautiful woman, and flies above our heads with its elegant wings.

[MSG$00EEC2,95]
It's not an illusion...As the angel flaps its wings, I can feel the wind caressing my cheeks...

[MSG$00EF2E,32]
Kitami "Not bad. I'm impressed."

[MSG$00EF68,99]
Kitami seems to be intrigued by the spectrum of light and power. But her expression stays the same.

[MSG$00EFD8,35]
Takashiro "Protect me Angel Aries!"

[MSG$00F016,45]
The angel moves to attack Dr. Kitami swiftly.

[MSG$00F050,56]
The angel flaps its wings, but is unable to go near her.

[MSG$00F08D,44]
It's as if she's being repelled by a magnet.

[MSG$00F0C6,43]
Kitami is watching the angel unconcerned...

[MSG$00F0FE,40]
Kitami "You annoying low-power angel..."

[MSG$00F140,17]
Kitami "Be gone!"

[MSG$00F2D0,40]
A cracking sound rolls through the room.

[MSG$00F2FD,56]
The angel disperses into the air, smashed into pieces...

[MSG$00F393,77]
Takashiro "What? My guardian angel can't be defeated with only one strike..."

[MSG$00F3FA,67]
Ms. Takashiro is in utter shock as she watches her angel disappear.

[MSG$00F4A1,59]
Kitami "That weak angel is nothing compared to Seraphim..."

[MSG$00F4F6,97]
Kitami "I can tell what kind of guardian angel you're able to control just by looking at by you."

[MSG$00F572,69]
Takashiro "You...who are you? You're much more powerful than Saeki...

[MSG$00F5BC,45]
Your evil aura...It's just like a demon's..."

[MSG$00F603,61]
Kitami "Of course. I made a pact with a demon. 12 years ago."

[MSG$00F65A,44]
Takashiro "I don't believe it. It can't be!"

[MSG$00F6A0,32]
Kitami "Why would you say that?"

[MSG$00F6DA,64]
Takashiro "It's not possible! Every member from back then died!"

[MSG$00F734,56]
Kitami "You just don't know everything that happened..."

[MSG$00F786,29]
Takashiro "What did you say?"

[MSG$00F7BD,51]
Kitami "You only saw the aftermath of the ritual...

[MSG$00F7F5,43]
You just assumed everyone was dead, right?"

[MSG$00F83A,29]
Takashiro "What do you mean?"

[MSG$00F871,49]
Kitami "I saw it with my own eyes. Everything..."

[MSG$00F8BC,55]
Takashiro "Why? How? Every one of the members was dead.

[MSG$00F8F8,59]
How could you be there, even though you had no part in it?"

[MSG$00F94D,101]
Kitami "All right, I'll tell you everything as a parting gift. What actually happened on that day..."

[MSG$00F9CC,62]
Ms. Takashiro and I waited anxiously for Dr. Kitami to talk...

[MSG$00FA17,68]
Kitami "Everything happened on that horrible night... of Walpurgis."

[MSG$00FA75,78]
Kitami "That coven of witches gathered 12 years ago on the night of Walpurgis.

[MSG$00FAC8,58]
They were trying to summon a demon in the basement room...

[MSG$00FB07,76]
They chanted in a magic circle, and made a blood sacrifice on that altar..."

[MSG$00FB6D,37]
Takashiro "Wait, who was sacrificed?"

[MSG$00FBAC,53]
Ms. Takashiro spoke up, a note of worry in her voice.

[MSG$00FBEE,28]
Kitami "Don't interrupt me."

[MSG$00FC24,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$00FC40,115]
Kitami "They needed to sacrifice someone special for the ritual...That's what it said in the Book of Magic, right?"

[MSG$00FCCD,48]
Kitami "Usually, a small animal is sacrificed...

[MSG$00FD02,77]
But for that ritual, they needed a sacrificial lamb with more life energy..."

[MSG$00FD69,15]
Takashiro "!!!"

[MSG$00FD92,43]
Takashiro "A human being was sacrificed..."

[MSG$00FDD7,41]
With those words, I looked at Ms. Kitami.

[MSG$00FE0D,64]
Kitami "That's right. I was the one lying down on that altar..."

[MSG$00FE67,46]
Kitami "I was knocked out with sleeping pills,

[MSG$00FE9A,72]
and then I was brought to that place without knowing what was going on."

[MSG$00FEFC,106]
Kitami "They could've chosen anyone they wanted...But somehow, it just happened to be me who was taken..."

[MSG$00FF80,36]
Takashiro "But how did you survive?"

[MSG$00FFBE,99]
Kitami "I'll tell you...The ritual went according to their plan. Spells were recited from the book,

[MSG$010026,45]
and the priest held a sword above my head..."

[MSG$01006D,22]
April 27 - 12 yeas ago

[MSG$0101D0,56]
Priest "El Elohim...Elohi Elohei Sabaoth Elion Sadai..."

[MSG$010222,38]
Priest "Ehyeh Asher...Ehyeh Adonai..."

[MSG$010262,44]
Priest "Jah Sadai...Tetragrammaton Sadai..."

[MSG$0102A8,45]
Priest "Agioso O Theos Ischiros Athanaton..."

[MSG$0103B8,19]
Kitami "Nnn! Nnnn!"

[MSG$0103E5,21]
Priest "Agla Amen..."

[MSG$0104DE,5]
Stab!

[MSG$0104F0,16]
Kitami "Nggggh!"

[MSG$01056B,118]
Priest "Sacrificial lamb. May you be our pillar of strength. After your sacrifice, give us the power of the Dark Gods.

[MSG$0105E6,86]
Sacrificial lamb. Give us the power to quell those demons who may rebel against us..."

[MSG$0106DF,62]
Priest "Oh sacrificial lamb, open the Gates of Heaven for us."

[MSG$010737,101]
Priest "Open the Gates. Princes, open the eternal doors and let the eternal king enter through them."

[MSG$0107B6,77]
Priest "Who is the eternal king? He is the holder of great wisdom and power."

[MSG$010808,39]
Open the gates. Open the eternal gates.

[MSG$010849,71]
Priest "Who is the eternal king? He is he's the almighty King of Kings.

[MSG$010895,53]
In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit!"

[MSG$0108E4,67]
Priest "Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas! Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas!

[MSG$01092C,70]
Everyone "Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas! Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas!"

[MSG$01098C,70]
Everyone "Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas! Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas!"

[MSG$0109D7,60]
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas! Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas!"

[MSG$010AA6,79]
Kitami "The spell used to open the gates of hell echoed throughout the room..."

[MSG$010B0F,78]
Kitami "The sword pierced my body, and my blood was painting the floor red..."

[MSG$010B77,61]
Kitami "But the gate didn't open...No, it was trying to open,

[MSG$010BB9,62]
but something was missing, and couldn't be opened entirely..."

[MSG$010C62,71]
Woman 1 "Something's wrong...It's incomplete! Maybe we made a mistake?"

[MSG$010CC3,90]
Priest "Impossible. We did everything according to the book. We didn't make any mistakes!"

[MSG$010D37,35]
Woman 1 "Then why doesn't it open?"

[MSG$010D74,68]
Woman 2 "No. The gate won't open completely! The ritual has failed!"

[MSG$010DD2,43]
Woman 3 "We did what we could...It's over!"

[MSG$010E68,29]
Priest "No...we need more..."

[MSG$010E9F,71]
Priest "We need more blood. We need to sacrifice more blood and souls!"

[MSG$010F00,49]
Woman 1 "What are you saying? It's too late now!"

[MSG$010F4B,59]
Priest "I wouldn't say that...Look...a sacrificial lamb..."

[MSG$010FA0,46]
Woman 1 "What are you doing? Are you serious?"

[MSG$010FE8,91]
Priest "Yes...Besides, do you think we can just go home without finishing what we started?"

[MSG$01105D,78]
Priest "If we stop this ritual, this would just be murder...I won't allow it."

[MSG$0110C5,32]
Woman 1 "What are you thinking?"

[MSG$0110FF,79]
Priest "Don't worry, you're just going to hell a bit earlier than you should...

[MSG$011153,40]
It's only going to hurt for a moment..."

[MSG$011195,26]
Woman 1 "No! Are you mad?"

[MSG$0111C9,116]
Priest "What are you talking about? All have us have been crazy from the beginning. Ever since we read that book..."

[MSG$011257,24]
Woman 1 "Stop it! Nami!"

[MSG$011289,12]
Woman 1"No!"

[MSG$0112AF,43]
Woman 2 "Stop! We're all on the same side!"

[MSG$011345,5]
Stab!

[MSG$011357,17]
Woman 1 "Gyaaaa!"

[MSG$011382,13]
Falls down...

[MSG$01139C,35]
Woman 2 "Saki! What have you done!"

[MSG$0113D9,33]
Priest "It's sad to die alone..."

[MSG$011414,47]
Woman 2 "You nutcase! What are you trying to do

[MSG$01145D,84]
Priest "Look..The Gate of Orkus is opening...Can you hear it? The roar from hell..."

[MSG$0114CB,43]
Woman 2 "Sanae! We have to close the gate!"

[MSG$011510,30]
Woman 3 "Close the gate? How?"

[MSG$011548,57]
Woman 2 "The last paragraph! The forbidden spell. Hurry!"

[MSG$01159B,15]
Woman 3 "Wait!"

[MSG$0115C4,25]
Woman 3 "Ah, here it is."

[MSG$0115F7,16]
Woman 2 "Hurgh!"

[MSG$011621,13]
Priest "Die!"

[MSG$011648,5]
Stab!

[MSG$01165A,15]
Woman 2 "Guha!"

[MSG$011683,17]
Falls to floor...

[MSG$0116A1,16]
Woman 3 "Hahhh!"

[MSG$0116CB,62]
Woman 3 "I command you. Hain Lon Hilay Sabaoth Helim Radisha."

[MSG$011723,59]
Woman 3 "Ledieha Adonai Jehova Jah Tetragrammaton Sadai..."

[MSG$011778,19]
Woman 3 "Mesias..."

[MSG$0117A5,24]
Woman 3 "No, stop it..."

[MSG$0117D7,60]
Priest "I won't let you...I won't let you close the gate..."

[MSG$01182D,37]
Woman 3 "No...I don't want to die..."

[MSG$01186C,20]
Priest "Good bye..."

[MSG$01189A,16]
Woman 3 "Kyaaa!"

[MSG$0119B1,72]
Kitami "So all the rest of the members were killed by the insane priest,

[MSG$0119FE,27]
unable to resist at all..."

[MSG$011A33,49]
Kitami "The floors were soaked with their blood."

[MSG$011A7E,38]
Kitami "Then I saw the gate open up...

[MSG$011AA9,60]
The Gate of Orkus opened, and a demon appeared before me..."

[MSG$011AFF,89]
Takashiro "That's insane...You were already dead...You couldn't have seen the gate open!"

[MSG$011B72,35]
Kitami "Heh, heh...you're right..."

[MSG$011BAF,35]
Kitami "But what if I wasn't dead?"

[MSG$011BED,49]
Takashiro "It can't be...you were still alive..."

[MSG$011C38,44]
Kitami "That's right...I was still alive..."

[MSG$011C7E,78]
Kitami "That's why the gate didn't open. The Priest didn't know, and lost it."

[MSG$011CE6,50]
Takashiro "What...Then they all died for nothing?"

[MSG$011D33,54]
Takashiro "But that doesn't explain why you survived."

[MSG$011D83,24]
Kitami "There's more..."

[MSG$011E2E,55]
Priest "Ahahahahahahahaha! Now, show yourself Belzebub.

[MSG$011E6A,21]
And do as I command!"

[MSG$011EEA,23]
Kitami "U...Ugh...Gha!"

[MSG$011F1B,79]
I was still alive...I was half conscious, and filled with vengeance and hatred.

[MSG$011FC8,17]
Kitami "Gu! Gha!"

[MSG$011FF3,104]
I pulled out the sword that was stuck in my body, and tried to kill the person responsible for all this.

[MSG$0120B9,21]
Kitami "Ha..ha..Geh!"

[MSG$0120E8,25]
Kitami "I'll kill you..."

[MSG$01211B,42]
Kitami "Kill you...kill you...kill you..."

[MSG$01215F,23]
Kitami "I'll kill you!"

[MSG$012190,14]
Priest "What?"

[MSG$012230,5]
Stab!

[MSG$012242,14]
Priest "Gyaa!"

[MSG$01226A,5]
Stab!

[MSG$01227C,13]
Kitami "Die!"

[MSG$0122A4,8]
Stabs...

[MSG$0122B9,25]
Kitami "Die...die...die!"

[MSG$0122ED,14]
Drops sword...

[MSG$0123F9,22]
Kitami "Ha..ha..geha!"

[MSG$012429,28]
Kitami "Hurts...it hurts..."

[MSG$012521,88]
Kitami "I came to my senses and looked around the room...It was like a portrait of hell.

[MSG$01257E,83]
There were dead bodies all around me, and the entire room was drenched in blood..."

[MSG$0125EB,61]
Kitami "I was choking because of the horrible smell of blood,

[MSG$01262D,87]
and I could feel my death closing in.  There was nothing I could do but wait for it..."

[MSG$01269E,72]
Kitami "But then I heard a voice...A demon's voice calling out to me..."

[MSG$012700,66]
Kitami "The demon asked me if I wanted to make a pact with him..."

[MSG$01275C,98]
Kitami "I had to do it. I was willing to make a pact with anyone in order to escape from the pain.

[MSG$0127C3,30]
If I didn't, I would've died."

[MSG$0127FC,93]
Kitami "Then I made a pact with the demon, and was granted limitless wealth and pleasures..."

[MSG$012988,62]
Kitami "I survived. Then I hid all the evidence from that day,

[MSG$0129CB,58]
and went on living my life as if nothing ever happened..."

[MSG$012A1F,23]
Takashiro "What the..."

[MSG$012A50,81]
Takashiro "Are you saying you were the student who was chosen to be a sacrifice?"

[MSG$012ABB,69]
Kitami "That's right. But instead, I sent that entire coven to hell."

[MSG$012B1A,76]
Kitami "You were very lucky. If you hadn't quit the coven right before that,

[MSG$012B6B,63]
your body would've been lying on the ground with the others..."

[MSG$012BC4,77]
Takashiro "You made a pact with the devil...Do you realize what you've done?"

[MSG$012C2B,65]
Takashiro "You're just borrowing power in exchange for your life.

[MSG$012C71,53]
If the pact expires, your body and soul will perish."

[MSG$012CC0,32]
Kitami "Of course, I know that."

[MSG$012CFA,39]
Takashiro "When does your pact expire?"

[MSG$012D3B,42]
Kitami "In 3 days...It's 3 days from now."

[MSG$012D7F,81]
Takashiro "3 days? Then 12...no, you were only able to make a pact for 13 years?"

[MSG$012DEA,97]
Kitami "I didn't exactly have a choice. But it's okay. I don't have to worry about that anymore."

[MSG$012E65,29]
Takashiro "What do you mean?"

[MSG$012E9C,49]
Kitami "I won't die. Even if the pact expires..."

[MSG$012EE7,100]
Takashiro "Impossible. A pact made with the devil is absolute. You can only escape from it by dying.

[MSG$012F50,45]
As long as you're alive, you can't get away."

[MSG$012F97,98]
Kitami "No, there is a way. A spell to deceive the devil...I spent a long time trying to find it."

[MSG$013013,64]
Takashiro "Are you serious? The pact has already been finalized.

[MSG$013058,37]
There's no way to cancel the pact..."

[MSG$013097,73]
Kitami "I don't care if you believe me or not. My ends justify any means.

[MSG$0130E5,34]
My ambitions know no limitations."

[MSG$013121,99]
Kitami "Who would be satisfied with only 12 years? It's not over yet. This is just the beginning...

[MSG$013189,38]
My plans are just coming to fruition!"

[MSG$0131C9,28]
Takashiro "You're insane..."

[MSG$0131FF,80]
Kitami "Let's put an end to all this...This conversation is becoming pointless."

[MSG$0132BB,37]
Ms. Kitami takes a step closer to us.

[MSG$0132ED,30]
Takashiro "Get out of here..."

[MSG$013325,49]
Takashiro "It's impossible...I can't beat her..."

[MSG$013370,85]
Takashiro "My powers are useless against a someone who's made a pact with the devil."

[MSG$0133DF,40]
Ms. Takashiro is whispering into my ear.

[MSG$013414,28]
Minase "But what about you?"

[MSG$01344A,65]
Takashiro "I'll try to buy you some time. Go ahead and escape..."

[MSG$0134A5,14]
Minase "What?"

[MSG$0134CD,84]
I try to object, but Ms. Takashiro shakes her head. Even if I can escape, what next?

[MSG$013526,54]
If Ms. Takashiro isn't with me, I can't do anything...

[MSG$013569,82]
Takashiro "If we stay here, we'll both be captured. You have to escape somehow..."

[MSG$0135D5,33]
Minase "But, even if I escape..."

[MSG$013610,105]
Takashiro "We don't have much time...They're not that stupid. They won't kill you if they don't have to."

[MSG$013693,60]
Takashiro "Besides, I have to find out what they're up to...

[MSG$0136D4,42]
If I don't, there'll be no stopping them."

[MSG$013718,87]
Takashiro "Don't worry...the pact with the devil will expire on the night of Walpurgis.

[MSG$013774,22]
Then Kitami will die."

[MSG$0137A4,62]
Takashiro "It bothers me that she's still so calm, however..."

[MSG$0137FD,67]
Kitami "Hey, why don't you stop talking and prepare for the worst?"

[MSG$01385A,105]
Kitami "If you join us, we promise not to hurt you. I'm sure both of you will like it...Heh, heh, heh..."

[MSG$0138DD,77]
Ms. Takashiro glances in my direction, then shouts as she pushes my shoulder.

[MSG$013937,19]
Takashiro "Go now!"

[MSG$0139DD,53]
I leave Ms. Takashiro behind and run out of the room.

[MSG$013A1F,37]
Kitami "You're not going anywhere..."

[MSG$013A5E,30]
Takashiro "I'm your opponent!"

[MSG$013A96,34]
Kitami "You're wasting your time."

[MSG$013AD2,23]
Takashiro "ZT ZT ZT..."

[MSG$013B7F,48]
I get out into the hallway, and try to run away.

[MSG$013C40,34]
Saeki "You're not going anywhere."

[MSG$013C7C,29]
Saeki appears in front of me.

[MSG$013CA6,14]
Minase "Move!"

[MSG$013CCE,51]
But she ignores me, and prepares to use her powers.

[MSG$013D0E,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$013D36,71]
I get close to Saeki, and I quickly take out the stun gun in my pocket.

[MSG$013D82,94]
Luckily, I'm faster than Saeki.  I shove the stun gun against her body and turn on the switch.

[MSG$013F17,4]
Zap!

[MSG$013F28,12]
Saeki "Gya!"

[MSG$013F4E,93]
Electric current runs through my right hand. Saeki opens her eyes wide as she begins to fall.

[MSG$013FDC,13]
Falls down...

[MSG$014017,84]
I ignore Saeki who is on the ground twitching, unlock the door and remove the chain.

[MSG$014070,37]
I kick the door open and run outside.

[MSG$01411E,4]
Bam!

[MSG$01412F,10]
Running...

[MSG$014146,53]
I keep running down the hallway without turning back.

[MSG$014205,80]
I'm worried about Ms. Takashiro, but I know I don't stand a chance against them.

[MSG$014262,79]
I try not to think about it, and run without stopping until I reach my house...

[MSG$0142C0,24]
April 27 - Minase's room

[MSG$0143C5,4]
Bam!

[MSG$0143D6,48]
I don't remember which route I took to get here.

[MSG$01440B,59]
When I was even conscious of it, I was back in my own room.

[MSG$014453,29]
Minase "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$01448A,53]
I place a hand on my chest and sit down on the floor.

[MSG$0144C4,75]
I got back...But Ms. Takashiro's still back there in that terrible place...

[MSG$01451C,90]
I can't ask for anybody's help. Even if I went to the police, they would never believe me.

[MSG$014583,50]
Minase "Shit...why did it have to be like this..."

[MSG$01464C,38]
My shoulders sag and my head lowers...

[MSG$014677,45]
I was both mentally and physically burnt out.

[MSG$0146B1,60]
No book, no Ms. Takashiro. I couldn't do anything anymore...

[MSG$0146FA,41]
Then I passed out and slept like a log...

[MSG$0147AB,9]
.........

[MSG$0147C1,6]
......

[MSG$0147D4,3]
...

[MSG$0147EB,18]
April 27 - Morning

[MSG$01480D,21]
Voice "Hey, wake up."

[MSG$01483C,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$014852,16]
Voice "Wake up."

[MSG$01487C,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$014892,57]
Voice "So, you're going to resist me? Okay...let's play."

[MSG$0148E5,20]
Removing blankets...

[MSG$014906,47]
My blanket is being removed from the bottom up.

[MSG$01493A,19]
My feet are cold...

[MSG$01495A,19]
Voice "Here we go."

[MSG$014987,7]
Grab...

[MSG$01499B,62]
Something is pressing against my crotch, and it feels weird...

[MSG$0149E6,17]
Groping crotch...

[MSG$014A04,19]
Minase "Ah..aah..."

[MSG$014A31,56]
I moan and I can feel a tingling sensation in my crotch.

[MSG$014A6E,77]
My crotch is being caressed skillfully.  It's an up and down circular motion.

[MSG$014AC8,32]
Voice "Hey now, feels good huh?"

[MSG$014B02,39]
I was confused, why was a feeling this?

[MSG$014B36,69]
The other day I told Imari to wake me up softly, but not like this...

[MSG$014B80,60]
Skillful moves...I didn't think she knew how to be so dirty.

[MSG$014BC9,26]
Wait, something's wrong...

[MSG$014BF0,61]
My relationship between Imari and myself collapsed yesterday.

[MSG$014C32,61]
It can't be her. Even though she can change moods in a hurry,

[MSG$014C74,41]
I don't think she would be this generous.

[MSG$014CAA,24]
Voice "Hey, hey, hey..."

[MSG$014CDC,42]
Plus this voice...it's different...like...

[MSG$014D0B,32]
I suddenly open up my eyes wide.

[MSG$014DD7,16]
Minase "Yukiko!"

[MSG$014E01,26]
Yukiko "Oh, you're awake?"

[MSG$014E35,28]
Minase "What are you doing?"

[MSG$014E6B,60]
I shout at Yukiko, who is caressing my crotch with her foot.

[MSG$014EB4,22]
Yukiko "Good morning."

[MSG$014EE4,38]
Yukiko "You're wide awake now, right?"

[MSG$014F24,21]
I jump out of my bed.

[MSG$014F3E,24]
What a way to wake up...

[MSG$014F95,85]
Yukiko "You were still sleeping, so I had to wake you up. You should be thanking me."

[MSG$015005,101]
Yukiko "But I guess Imari Kurumi isn't coming to wake you up. Did you two have a fight or something?"

[MSG$015084,28]
Minase "No, it's nothing..."

[MSG$0150BA,52]
Yukiko "And how did you like the way I woke you up?"

[MSG$015108,48]
My sister smiled with a dirty look as she asked.

[MSG$015145,29]
Minase "What, are you crazy?"

[MSG$01517C,30]
Well honestly, it felt good...

[MSG$01519F,77]
But if I say that, then she's gonna start using this technique to pick on me.

[MSG$0151F9,81]
Yukiko "Don't feel embarrassed. It's natural for boys your age to feel this way."

[MSG$015264,29]
Minase "All right, I get it."

[MSG$01529B,39]
Minase "Now get out. I'm gonna change."

[MSG$0152DC,55]
Yukiko "It's not healthy to be such a prude, you know."

[MSG$01532D,42]
I kick my annoying sister out of the room.

[MSG$015388,13]
Slams door...

[MSG$0153A2,31]
What kind of a sister is she...

[MSG$0153C6,74]
But seeing that Imari isn't here to wake me up, this must be very serious.

[MSG$015415,63]
I guess it's obvious if I consider the events from yesterday...

[MSG$015461,53]
I don't blame her for being angry. It's all my fault.

[MSG$01549B,78]
I don't think we can kiss and make up, exactly. She seemed pretty horrified.

[MSG$0154F6,67]
There won't be anyone coming to wake me up in the mornings anymore.

[MSG$015546,32]
Wait...there's one other person.

[MSG$01556B,61]
Yes, I can ask Shiraki...I'm sure she can take Imari's place.

[MSG$0155B5,31]
I guess I'll try and ask her...

[MSG$015672,58]
I prepare to go to school, and leave the house in a hurry.

[MSG$0156B1,64]
It's been a long time since I walked over to the school alone...

[MSG$015706,31]
April 27 - Front gate of school

[MSG$0157A4,54]
I pass through the gate and enter the school as usual.

[MSG$015863,67]
It's the same scenery as always...But that's just on the outside...

[MSG$0158B3,38]
This school is filled with evil power.

[MSG$0158DE,59]
And I can feel as if I'm being sucked toward the dark side.

[MSG$015926,88]
I try to escape from it, but the more I struggle to be free, the more I get sucked in...

[MSG$015983,50]
I wonder if I can ever lead a normal life again...

[MSG$0159C2,55]
If I had a choice, I wouldn't come back to this school.

[MSG$0159FE,62]
But I know I can't accomplish anything if I keep running away.

[MSG$015A49,82]
If I can't free myself from that book, I'll never be able to live a normal life...

[MSG$015B42,60]
As I was changing my shoes, I saw the silhouette of someone.

[MSG$015B8B,13]
Minase "Hmm?"

[MSG$015BE4,54]
I spotted Mika Ito's figure in the corner of my eye...

[MSG$015C27,15]
Minase "Ito..."

[MSG$015C74,65]
But Ito doesn't hear me, and in an instant she is out of sight...

[MSG$015CC2,78]
I try to go after her, but then I stop, remembering what happened on that day.

[MSG$015D1D,57]
It was the first time I had experimented with the book...

[MSG$015D5B,52]
After that, Ito stopped coming to school completely.

[MSG$015D94,50]
But why would she come back today all of a sudden?

[MSG$015DD3,15]
Was I mistaken?

[MSG$015DE7,71]
No, I didn't mistake someone else for Ito. That was definitely Ito...

[MSG$015E3B,76]
I immediately checked the shoe shelf, but it was just the same as yesterday,

[MSG$015E8C,63]
with her pair of slippers still inside... She hadn't been here.

[MSG$015ED8,35]
Maybe it was just my imagination...

[MSG$015F08,65]
I change into my slippers and head over to Shiraki's first class.

[MSG$015F56,18]
April 27 - Hallway

[MSG$015FE7,58]
As I go head for her class, Shiraki comes out of the room.

[MSG$016060,17]
Shiraki "Minase."

[MSG$01608B,66]
Shiraki looks at me, and approaches me with a cheerful expression.

[MSG$0160DA,32]
Shiraki "You're here to see me?"

[MSG$016114,14]
Minase "Yeah."

[MSG$01613C,105]
As Shiraki and I are talk to each other, other guys passing through the halls stare at me with cold eyes.

[MSG$0161AA,50]
I guess Shiraki's pretty popular among the guys...

[MSG$0161E9,39]
Minase "I need you to do me a favor..."

[MSG$01622A,21]
Shiraki "What is it?"

[MSG$016259,88]
Shiraki's eyes brightened and she looked at me, as if she wanted me to ask her anything.

[MSG$0162BE,66]
Minase "Can you come and wake me up in the morning...at my house?"

[MSG$01631A,16]
Shiraki "Can I?"

[MSG$016344,24]
Shiraki happily replied.

[MSG$016369,22]
Minase "Yeah, please."

[MSG$016399,21]
Shiraki "Yeah, sure."

[MSG$0163C8,35]
Minase "Okay, I'm counting on you."

[MSG$016405,65]
Shiraki "All right! I'm coming to wake you up starting tomorrow."

[MSG$016484,42]
I part from her after we make the promise.

[MSG$0164B3,75]
Phew...I guess I won't have to worry about being late to school tomorrow...

[MSG$01650B,45]
I pass by Ms. Takashiro on my way to class...

[MSG$016577,25]
Takashiro "Good morning."

[MSG$0165AA,22]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$0165DA,49]
Takashiro "I have something to give you, Minase."

[MSG$016625,62]
Ms. Takashiro hands over a small folded paper from her pocket.

[MSG$016670,32]
Takashiro "Okay, see you later."

[MSG$0166CE,56]
I stuff the paper into my pocket and head towards class.

[MSG$016713,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$0167A6,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0167C4,48]
There's no sign of Saeki or Imari in the room...

[MSG$0167F9,21]
They're not here yet?

[MSG$01681B,66]
I sit at my chair and read the memo that I got from Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$016862,23]
This is what it says:

[MSG$016886,73]
''During lunch time, I want you to bring Saeki to the back of the school.

[MSG$0168D7,49]
If I go with you, she'll suspect my intensions.''

[MSG$016910,10]
-Takashiro

[MSG$016927,24]
I have to bring Saeki...

[MSG$016944,81]
But if she doesn't come in at all today, then I can't bring her to Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$0169A2,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0169F2,50]
Just when I was thinking about Saeki, she appears.

[MSG$016A29,67]
She takes a seat at her desk with the same sinister look as always.

[MSG$016AAE,17]
The bell rings...

[MSG$016ACC,35]
The bell rings, and class begins...

[MSG$016AF4,82]
Imari didn't come after all. It looks like she doesn't want to see my face at all.

[MSG$016B53,82]
I guess she really hates me. Usually, she hits me 2 or 3 times and then it's over,

[MSG$016BAA,44]
but I guess it's pretty serious this time...

[MSG$016BE3,10]
Oh well...

[MSG$016BF2,81]
It's not like apologizing is going to do any good, Imari will never forgive me...

[MSG$016D87,21]
April 27 - Lunch time

[MSG$016E34,18]
The bell sounds...

[MSG$016E53,54]
I try to head towards Saeki's desk as the bell sounds.

[MSG$016E96,48]
Saeki gets up from her seat and leaves the room.

[MSG$016ECB,37]
I leave the room and run after Saeki.

[MSG$016F9D,57]
I catch up with Saeki, and call out her name from behind.

[MSG$016FE3,15]
Minase "Saeki!"

[MSG$01700C,30]
Saeki turns around in silence.

[MSG$01706A,43]
Minase "Can you come with me for a second?"

[MSG$0170AF,70]
I pretend to sound calm as I ask her. I try not to look into her eyes.

[MSG$0170FA,48]
Honestly, I really don't want to see her face...

[MSG$017137,33]
Saeki "What do you want from me?"

[MSG$017172,62]
Minase "Come with me and you'll find out. It won't take long."

[MSG$0171CA,35]
I keep my eyes averted as I talk...

[MSG$0171FA,83]
Saeki listens, and it looks like she's thinking it over as she stares hard at me...

[MSG$017252,71]
Her eyes seem to see right through me, and a shiver runs down my spine.

[MSG$0172A6,49]
After a moment of silence, Saeki opens her mouth.

[MSG$0172E4,37]
Saeki "All right...I'll go with you."

[MSG$017323,37]
I sigh with relief after she says it.

[MSG$01734D,66]
If she refused to come with me, then I know I'd be pretty screwed.

[MSG$01739C,37]
Saeki "Are we going or not? Come on."

[MSG$0173DB,62]
I try to hold down the feeling of panic, and show her the way.

[MSG$01742C,60]
* Return point after Takashiro and Saeki finish their battle

[MSG$01746D,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$017500,61]
I return to class, and the bell rings. I quickly take a seat.

[MSG$01754A,51]
Of course, Saeki hasn't come back after her escape.

[MSG$01760E,36]

[MSG$0176C1,58]
And finally, my boring afternoon classes come to an end...

[MSG$01779D,18]
The bell sounds...

[MSG$0177BC,23]
April 27 - After school

[MSG$0177EF,81]
I pack up my stuff, and head towards the art room where Ms. Takashiro is waiting.

[MSG$0178C9,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0178E7,72]
Maybe I'm a bit early, since there's nobody else from the art club here.

[MSG$017934,54]
But Ms. Takashiro is standing in middle of the room...

[MSG$0179A9,38]
Ms. Takashiro and I nod to each other.

[MSG$0179DC,21]
Takashiro "Let's go."

[MSG$017A0B,39]
Ms. Takashiro and I leave the art room.

[MSG$017AAB,60]
Classes are over...I wonder if Ms. Takashiro is all right...

[MSG$017AF4,58]
Worrying about her, I pack up my stuff and leave the room.

[MSG$017BB7,68]
I don't think Imari will ask me to come to the club meeting today...

[MSG$017C00,58]
Actually, it's kind of sad that she won't come and ask me.

[MSG$017C7A,19]
Shiraki "Minase..."

[MSG$017CA7,87]
As I leave the classroom, I see that Shiraki is standing outside, somewhat embarrassed.

[MSG$017D0B,64]
Shiraki "I was waiting for you. Do you want to go home with me?"

[MSG$017D65,14]
Minase "Sure."

[MSG$017D8D,32]
Shiraki and I start heading out.

[MSG$017DB2,48]
Now I don't have to go home by myself, either...

[MSG$017DEF,69]
Several girls nearby look at us and start whispering to each other...

[MSG$017E41,58]
But Shiraki and I head towards the shoe shelves quietly...

[MSG$017E88,84]
Shiraki occasionally looks in my direction, and her face reddens a bit as she walks.

[MSG$017EE1,77]
But I is my head was filled with Ms. Takashiro, and I'm just not in the mood.

[MSG$017F3B,47]
The more I think about it, the worse it gets...

[MSG$017F77,73]
We go down the stairs and reach the shoe shelves. And I say to Shiraki...

[MSG$01806C,92]
Minase "I'm sorry Shiraki. I have somewhere I've got to be, so can you go home by yourself?"

[MSG$0180E2,29]
Shiraki "What? Yeah, sure..."

[MSG$01813D,32]
Shiraki seems very disappointed.

[MSG$01816A,54]
After Shiraki and I part, I run to find Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$0181A5,28]
I should've gone with her...

[MSG$0181C6,110]
If she goes by herself and something happens to her, I won't get another good night's sleep as long as I live.

[MSG$018241,47]
Maybe Ms. Takashiro is still in the art room...

[MSG$018302,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$018320,42]
But I don't see any sign of Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$01834F,59]
I ask a member of the art club, and I'm told she just left.

[MSG$018397,61]
I leave the art room and head over to the professor's lounge.

[MSG$018466,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$018484,95]
I open the door of the staff room, looking for Ms. Takashiro...But I don't see any sign of her.

[MSG$0184E8,24]
She left campus already?

[MSG$01850D,53]
I ask a professor nearby, and I'm told she just left.

[MSG$01854F,41]
I quickly run over to the front entrance.

[MSG$018601,75]
I go down to the 1st floor, and luckily, I find Ms. Takashiro just in time.

[MSG$01868C,23]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro!"

[MSG$0186BD,34]
Takashiro "Minase...What's wrong?"

[MSG$0186F9,28]
Minase "I'm going with you."

[MSG$01872F,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$01875A,59]
Minase "I'm just worried about letting you go on your own."

[MSG$0187AF,51]
Takashiro "Hahaha!...All right, let's go together."

[MSG$0187FC,70]
Ms. Takashiro and I nod to each other and leave the school together...

[MSG$018847,96]
After Ms. Takashiro and I killed some time, we ended up heading to Saeki's apartment building...

[MSG$018971,72]
I ignore Saeki who is on the ground twitching, and try to open the door.

[MSG$0189C6,11]
Suddenly...

[MSG$018A76,17]
Getting struck...

[MSG$018A94,13]
Minase "Guh!"

[MSG$018B34,85]
I suddenly felt a stinging sensation in my side, and everything begins to turn white.

[MSG$018B8E,45]
A kick is perfectly planted right in my side.

[MSG$018BC0,37]
I guess there is someone else here...

[MSG$018BF2,32]
Voice "I won't let you leave..."

[MSG$018C2C,70]
I'm losing consciousness, but I recognize that voice from somewhere...

[MSG$018C7F,51]
Then I lose consciousness and fall to the ground...

[MSG$018D3A,33]
.................................

[MSG$018D68,24]
........................

[MSG$018D8D,18]
..................

[MSG$018DAC,12]
............

[MSG$018DC5,6]
......

[MSG$018DD8,29]
Takashiro "Nn! Unah! Ghaf..."

[MSG$018E0F,66]
I regain consciousness, hearing the sound of despondent moaning...

[MSG$018E56,33]
I still feel the pain in my side.

[MSG$018E84,38]
I open my eyes slowly and look around.

[MSG$018F2F,57]
It's a dark room...The floors are cold, and hard as hell.

[MSG$018F75,30]
Minase "What is this place..."

[MSG$018FAD,109]
I couldn't figure out what was going on.  My mind was still fuzzy as I tried to remember how I ended up here.

[MSG$01901F,48]
That's right...I was at Saeki's apartment and...

[MSG$01908F,22]
Saeki "Are you awake?"

[MSG$0190BF,18]
Saeki spoke to me.

[MSG$0190DE,15]
Minase "Saeki!"

[MSG$019107,72]
Saeki is wearing a strange robe, and she's eyeing me with a cold look...

[MSG$01915C,86]
Saeki "Thanks for zapping me with that stun gun...You're gonna pay for that big time."

[MSG$0191CC,12]
Saeki grins.

[MSG$0191DD,109]
That's right, I knocked Saeki out with the stun gun, but then I lost consciousness after someone kicked me...

[MSG$019257,31]
That means they've captured me.

[MSG$01927B,89]
I tried moving my hands and feet, but it felt like I was tied up. I couldn't move at all.

[MSG$0192E1,55]
Minase "Wait... what have you done with Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$019332,62]
Saeki "Oh her? She's over there having fun with our Mistress."

[MSG$01938A,62]
I twisted my body to look in the direction Saeki was pointing.

[MSG$019459,29]
Takashiro "Guh...Ngh...Gbha!"

[MSG$019490,39]
Dr. Kitami was torturing Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$0194C4,30]
Her mouth is forced wide open,

[MSG$0194E7,41]
with a rubber hose stuck down her throat.

[MSG$019515,80]
Water is being pumped from the hose, and is trickling out from around her mouth.

[MSG$019572,30]
Kitami "You're awake, Minase."

[MSG$0195AA,53]
Kitami "Well? Ms. Takashiro looks cute, doesn't she?"

[MSG$0195F9,43]
Ms. Kitami presses Ms. Takashiro's abdomen.

[MSG$019631,16]
Takashiro "Fgh!"

[MSG$01965B,48]
Ms. Takashiro opens her eyes wide and struggles.

[MSG$019698,107]
Kitami "This is called water torture.  It was used by pagans back in the good old days of the witch hunts."

[MSG$01971D,90]
Kitami "First, you force them to drink 4 liters of water, and if they still don't confess,

[MSG$01977C,29]
another 4 liters are given...

[MSG$01979E,32]
You simply repeat that process."

[MSG$0197D8,79]
Kitami "It's more effective to apply pain from the inside and then the outside.

[MSG$01982C,52]
Anyone will be forced to confess sooner or later..."

[MSG$01987A,57]
Kitami turns off the faucet that is attached to the hose.

[MSG$0198B8,70]
Ms. Takashiro's  pain is lessened a bit, and she seems to be relieved.

[MSG$01990B,18]
Takashiro "Guh..."

[MSG$019938,83]
Maybe she drank a lot.  Her stomach had swelled up, almost like a pregnant woman's.

[MSG$019998,76]
Kitami "It's too early for you to give up. You've got plenty more to drink."

[MSG$0199FE,40]
Dr. Kitami pats Ms. Takashiro's stomach.

[MSG$019A33,33]
Minase "Stop, she's gonna burst!"

[MSG$019A6E,51]
Kitami "Don't worry, humans don't die this easily."

[MSG$019ABB,46]
Minase "Why do you think this is so much fun?"

[MSG$019B03,63]
Kitami "Nothing...I just want to be friends with Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$019B47,40]
I'm sure we'll come to be really close."

[MSG$019B89,83]
Kitami "But she's very stubborn, so unfortunately I have to do this kind of thing."

[MSG$019BF6,64]
Who is she kidding? Dr. Kitami is defiantly getting off on this.

[MSG$019C43,50]
Kitami "Okay, break time is over. Let's continue."

[MSG$019C8F,90]
Ms. Kitami then turns on the faucet and forces more water down into Ms. Takashiro's mouth.

[MSG$019CF6,21]
Takashiro "Geh! Kha!"

[MSG$019D25,46]
Ms. Takashiro chokes and throws up some water.

[MSG$019D58,92]
Her stomach is swelling, and looks like it might burst any moment. I think she's had enough.

[MSG$019DC1,28]
Takashiro "Geh! Gha, gha..."

[MSG$019DF7,53]
She painfully coughs up lots of water from her mouth.

[MSG$019EB2,73]
Kitami "You've had enough water? I'll give you something really special."

[MSG$019F15,56]
Kitami "Romanee-Conti...Pretty classy, don't you think?"

[MSG$019F67,62]
Ms. Kitami brings out a wine bottle that looks very expensive.

[MSG$019FAA,45]
Then she uses a corkscrew to open the bottle.

[MSG$019FE4,57]
Kitami "Smells good...That's what I'd expect from a '66."

[MSG$01A037,87]
Kitami "You don't get a chance to drink this kind of wine very often. Savor the taste."

[MSG$01A121,17]
She pours wine...

[MSG$01A13F,59]
Dr. Kitami pours the red liquid into Ms. Takashiro's mouth.

[MSG$01A17F,46]
Ms. Takashiro is forced to drink the liquid...

[MSG$01A1BA,82]
Maybe it because she spit out so much water, but she was able to drink the liquid.

[MSG$01A211,23]
Her face was contorted.

[MSG$01A235,26]
Takashiro "Ng! Ng! Ugh..."

[MSG$01A269,18]
Water splashing...

[MSG$01A288,50]
The wine is swallowed by Ms. Takashiro in no time.

[MSG$01A2BF,36]
She drinks it down with great speed.

[MSG$01A2F0,25]
Kitami "A little more..."

[MSG$01A39C,58]
Ms. Takashiro empties the bottle and releases a huge burp.

[MSG$01A3E3,109]
Kitami "Amazing. You're probably the first person to drink a entire bottle of Romanee-Conti in that position.

[MSG$01A455,11]
Ahahahaha!"

[MSG$01A47A,61]
Kitami "As a reward, I'll remove that thing from your mouth."

[MSG$01A4D1,55]
Ms. Kitami removes the plug from Ms. Takashiro's mouth.

[MSG$01A58E,18]
Takashiro "Geh..."

[MSG$01A5BA,44]
Then Ms. Takashiro falls limp in exhaustion.

[MSG$01A5F3,84]
Ms. Takashiro's face and body starts to flush. I guess the alcohol is taking effect.

[MSG$01A654,34]
Kitami "Nice color you got there."

[MSG$01A690,30]
Takashiro "Stop it already..."

[MSG$01A6C8,70]
Ms. Takashiro was sweating, salivating, crying, and begging for mercy.

[MSG$01A71B,58]
Her eyes were bloodshot, and her cheeks and ears were red.

[MSG$01A75A,88]
I guess anyone would be drunk after finishing an entire bottle of wine in a few minutes.

[MSG$01A7BF,48]
Kitami "You're so weak. Exhausted so quickly..."

[MSG$01A809,37]
Kitami "So...do you want to join us?"

[MSG$01A848,30]
Takashiro "I can't do that..."

[MSG$01A880,94]
Kitami "Oh really...You still have the energy to persist. Then we can have a little more fun."

[MSG$01A8F8,32]
Takashiro "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$01A932,35]
Takashiro "Uu...Stop it already..."

[MSG$01A96F,96]
Ms. Takashiro's face is all red, and she tries to be defiant by speaking as clearly as possible.

[MSG$01A9DC,33]
Kitami "Oh...do you want to pee?"

[MSG$01AA17,67]
Kitami "You drank so much.  You're probably about to burst, right?"

[MSG$01AAED,51]
Ms. Kitami presses down on Ms. Takashiro's stomach.

[MSG$01AB2D,15]
Takashiro "No."

[MSG$01AB56,99]
Ms. Takashiro brakes out in a clammy sweat.  It looks like she's barely containing her urge to pee.

[MSG$01ABC6,74]
Kitami "There's no point in holding it. You're gonna wet yourself anyway."

[MSG$01AC2A,80]
Kitami "You probably can't get to the bathroom with a stomach like that, right?"

[MSG$01AC94,23]
Takashiro "Hahahahaha!"

[MSG$01ACC5,56]
Kitami "Let it out. I don't mind if you pee right here."

[MSG$01AD17,22]
Takashiro "No...no..."

[MSG$01AD47,19]
Takashiro "Uu! Uu!"

[MSG$01ADED,9]
Peeing...

[MSG$01AE03,51]
Clear liquid sprays out of Ms. Takashiro's urethra.

[MSG$01AE43,58]
Whether it's too late or not, she quickly holds it back by

[MSG$01AE82,30]
clenching her vaginal muscles.

[MSG$01AEAD,97]
Kitami "I think you've reached a limit. If you hold it too long, your bladder is going to burst."

[MSG$01AF28,93]
Ms. Takashiro tries to hold it in for a while, but she finally reaches her limit and screams.

[MSG$01AF92,42]
Takashiro "I'm going to wet myself...Uun!"

[MSG$01B04F,9]
Peeing...

[MSG$01B065,21]
Takashiro "Ugh! Hya!"

[MSG$01B094,100]
Large amounts of clear pee pours out from her urethra, as if the floodgates had suddenly broke open.

[MSG$01B105,9]
Peeing...

[MSG$01B11B,93]
Liquid keeps pouring out with a trail of warm steam.  It creates a water puddle on the floor.

[MSG$01B17D,62]
Maybe it was because of the water, but it didn't smell at all.

[MSG$01B1C8,65]
I'm in total shock because of the bizarre scene I'm witnessing...

[MSG$01B216,79]
Kitami "Ahahahaha! That's something to see! Do you pee like this all the time?"

[MSG$01B27F,19]
Takashiro "Uh! Uh!"

[MSG$01B2AC,99]
Ms. Takashiro thrusts out her hips over and over again, releasing every drop of liquid in her body.

[MSG$01B395,68]
Kitami "You released quite a load. Now, let's start over, shall we?"

[MSG$01B3F3,18]
Takashiro "What!?"

[MSG$01B41F,86]
Ms. Takashiro is so shocked by what she heard, she can't help but blurt out a protest.

[MSG$01B482,54]
Kitami "Now, I'll let you drink from a different hole.

[MSG$01B4BD,70]
If you don't drink it up fast enough, you might suffocate. Ahahahaha!"

[MSG$01B5BD,32]
Minase "Stop it! That's enough!"

[MSG$01B5F7,53]
I can't take it anymore.  I'm shouting at Ms. Kitami.

[MSG$01B639,48]
Kitami "No. This is what you get for defying us.

[MSG$01B66E,102]
I'm afraid I'll have to continue until Ms. Takashiro gets down on her hands and knees in front of me."

[MSG$01B6EE,21]
Minase "You devil..."

[MSG$01B71D,64]
Kitami "Besides, I think you should worry about yourself first."

[MSG$01B777,14]
Minase "What?"

[MSG$01B79F,44]
Kitami "Do you think we'll just let you go?"

[MSG$01B7E5,59]
Kitami "You're gonna get a taste of what we have to offer."

[MSG$01B83A,80]
Kitami "You're a man, so I'll use a much more effective method to entertain you.

[MSG$01B88F,58]
I'm sure you'll give in much faster than Ms. Takashiro..."

[MSG$01B8E3,22]
Kitami "Do it, Saeki."

[MSG$01B96A,22]
Saeki "Yes, Mistress."

[MSG$01B99A,59]
Saeki did as she was told, and kicked me over on the floor.

[MSG$01BA5F,28]
Minase "What are you doing?"

[MSG$01BA95,47]
Saeki "Something fun. I'm sure you'll like it."

[MSG$01BADE,26]
Minase "I don't think so!"

[MSG$01BB12,45]
Saeki "We'll just have to see now, won't we?"

[MSG$01BB59,104]
Saeki "Now, I'll introduce you to one of our newest members. I'm sure you'll like her. Heh, heh, heh..."

[MSG$01BBDB,27]
Saeki "Now, come this way."

[MSG$01BC10,32]
A girl appears in front of me...

[MSG$01BC3D,15]
Minase "Imari?"

[MSG$01BCE2,92]
From the way she was dressed, I thought I was mistaken at first, but she was really Imari...

[MSG$01BD4B,81]
Then I realized that the voice I heard before I lost consciousness was Imari's...

[MSG$01BDA9,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$01BDC1,40]
Imari is looking at me with vacant eyes.

[MSG$01BDEE,48]
She looks a lot different than the Imari I know.

[MSG$01BE2B,79]
The way she was dressed, it was pretty clear that she wasn't in her right mind.

[MSG$01BE87,52]
She's almost naked...The kinky black leather costume

[MSG$01BEC0,31]
looks very out of place on her.

[MSG$01BEEC,25]
Minase "Why is she here?"

[MSG$01BF1F,37]
Saeki "I think you know exactly why."

[MSG$01BF5E,24]
Saeki "Imari was crying.

[MSG$01BF7B,56]
I heard you betrayed her... Right in front of her eyes."

[MSG$01BFCD,20]
Minase "That was..."

[MSG$01BFFB,90]
I try to explain what happened, but words don't come out. What I have done is inexcusable.

[MSG$01C062,77]
Saeki "Imari was feeling very depressed, so we helped her forget everything."

[MSG$01C0C9,40]
Saeki "She was very happy to join us..."

[MSG$01C10B,14]
Minase "What?"

[MSG$01C133,24]
Why did Imari join them?

[MSG$01C158,32]
Minase "Come on Imari! Wake up!"

[MSG$01C192,54]
Imari "You're the one who needs to wake up, Minase..."

[MSG$01C1E2,71]
Imari "You're stupid to go against Mistress Kitami. You should join us.

[MSG$01C22E,51]
Then we can be friends again like we used to be..."

[MSG$01C27B,48]
Imari speaks while looking at me with cold eyes.

[MSG$01C2B8,67]
This isn't the Imari I know. She is just like Saeki and the others,

[MSG$01C300,33]
filled with coldness and cruelty.

[MSG$01C32E,44]
She's been completely brainwashed by them...

[MSG$01C35F,50]
I didn't have the power to save Imari after all...

[MSG$01C39E,16]
Minase "What..."

[MSG$01C3C8,66]
Saeki "Now you know, Imari is living in the same world as we are."

[MSG$01C424,55]
Saeki "Plus, she's special. She'll be key to our plans.

[MSG$01C460,43]
But you two are just garbage in our way..."

[MSG$01C4A5,87]
Saeki "That's why we need to teach you a lesson, so you can't interfere with us again."

[MSG$01C516,34]
Minase "What are you going to do?"

[MSG$01C552,64]
Saeki "Imari. Show Minase what we're all about.  Use your body."

[MSG$01C5AC,14]
Imari "Yes..."

[MSG$01C5D4,49]
Imari obeys Saeki's orders, as if she is a robot.

[MSG$01C612,29]
Minase "Shit! Wake up Imari!"

[MSG$01C649,66]
I move my body back and fourth, desperately trying to free myself.

[MSG$01C698,72]
Saeki "Stop struggling, Minase. We're going to make you feel real good."

[MSG$01C6FA,63]
Saeki "If you're not willing to listen, it's gonna get hurt..."

[MSG$01C753,52]
Saeki approached me, holding a stun gun in her hand.

[MSG$01C78C,32]
It's the stun gun I used on her.

[MSG$01C7B9,21]
Minase "That's my..."

[MSG$01C7E8,75]
Saeki "Thanks for zapping me before. This is just to show my appreciation."

[MSG$01C84D,65]
Saeki places the stun gun against my body and presses the switch.

[MSG$01C89B,4]
Zap!

[MSG$01C99D,13]
Minase "Gya!"

[MSG$01C9C4,105]
A strong electric current flows through me.  My back arcs backwards as I convulse, and then I fall quiet.

[MSG$01CA32,68]
Both my arms and legs are numb from the shock.  I can't move at all.

[MSG$01CA83,19]
Saeki "Now, Imari."

[MSG$01CB50,46]
Imari nods, removes her black leather panties,

[MSG$01CB83,44]
and exposes her pussy without even blushing.

[MSG$01CBBC,91]
I see Imari's fresh vagina in front of me. Imari doesn't seem interested in covering it up.

[MSG$01CC24,48]
Minase "Stop...Are you out of your mind, Imari?"

[MSG$01CC6E,60]
Saeki "Aha. No matter what you say, you're getting excited."

[MSG$01CCC4,71]
I realize that my penis is getting hard, and it's pointing straight up.

[MSG$01CD10,46]
Even in times like these, it reacts naturally.

[MSG$01CD4B,59]
Minase "You did this to Imari. I'll make you pay for this!"

[MSG$01CDA0,109]
Saeki "Soon, you won't even think to say that kind of thing. You're gonna suffer and beg us for forgiveness."

[MSG$01CE27,52]
Saeki "Besides, you'll never escape from this place.

[MSG$01CE60,51]
You won't even want to leave here. Just like us..."

[MSG$01CEAE,84]
Saeki takes a container filled with lotion, places the opening right up Imari's ass,

[MSG$01CF07,26]
and pours in the contents.

[MSG$01CF2E,14]
Imari "Kfu..."

[MSG$01CF56,20]
Saeki "Okay, Imari."

[MSG$01CF84,55]
Imari slowly squats, and places her ass above my penis.

[MSG$01D044,51]
Imari "Minase...I'll entertain you with my body..."

[MSG$01D091,78]
Imari "Sorry Minase, but I'm only going to let Ms. Kitami do me in the vagina.

[MSG$01D0E4,40]
So, I'll let you screw me up the ass..."

[MSG$01D126,48]
She places her ass down on the head of my penis.

[MSG$01D163,19]
Minase "Stop it..."

[MSG$01D190,72]
Imari ignores me and little by little, pushes her ass down on my cock...

[MSG$01D1E5,22]
Imari "Here I come..."

[MSG$01D215,13]
Imari "Unaa!"

[MSG$01D2B5,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$01D2CE,13]
Minase "Aah!"

[MSG$01D2F5,70]
The head of my penis pushes open Imari's ass, and it goes deep inside.

[MSG$01D348,51]
I moan with the sensation and the numbing pleasure.

[MSG$01D380,88]
The inside of Imari was burning hot, and it felt good and slippery thanks to the lotion.

[MSG$01D3E5,68]
Saeki "Does it feel that good? Then you're gonna come way too fast."

[MSG$01D443,48]
Saeki "I'm not gonna let you get off that easy."

[MSG$01D48D,56]
Saeki then placed something around the base of my penis.

[MSG$01D4D2,52]
Saeki "Now you won't be able to come that easily..."

[MSG$01D599,26]
The feeling of pressure...

[MSG$01D5C0,13]
Minase "Guh!"

[MSG$01D5E7,44]
I feel a very firm pressure around my penis.

[MSG$01D618,80]
Saeki wrapped a plastic band around my penis, and pulled it as tight as it gets.

[MSG$01D675,36]
Minase "It hurts! Get it if off me!"

[MSG$01D6B3,53]
Saeki "Nope. I won't let you come until you join us."

[MSG$01D702,29]
Minase "What...why should I?"

[MSG$01D739,72]
Saeki "Then go ahead and suffer, see how it feels to be unable to come!"

[MSG$01D79B,13]
Minase "Kuh!"

[MSG$01D7C2,10]
Banging...

[MSG$01D7D9,94]
Imari doesn't care what I was saying.  She keeps sliding up and down rhythmically on my penis.

[MSG$01D844,94]
Every time I slide into her ass, I feel waves of pleasure passing through the head of my cock.

[MSG$01D8A7,44]
My body shakes with the urge to come rising.

[MSG$01D8E0,23]
Minase "Hah..hah..kuh!"

[MSG$01D911,56]
And then I reach my first peak and push my hips forward.

[MSG$01D94E,51]
But the feeling goes away, since I can't ejaculate.

[MSG$01D98E,35]
My orgasm disappears in an instant.

[MSG$01D9BE,26]
Minase "Aah! Take it off!"

[MSG$01D9F2,71]
I'm trembling with frustration, and I yell at Saeki to remove the band.

[MSG$01DA46,44]
Saeki "Heh, heh, you give up? How pathetic."

[MSG$01DA8C,55]
Saeki "You want to get off? Then will you be my slave?"

[MSG$01DADD,40]
Saeki is grinning as she sees me suffer.

[MSG$01DB12,52]
I try very hard to keep my excitement under control.

[MSG$01DB4B,53]
If I give in to them, everything will come to an end.

[MSG$01DB8D,95]
Without paying any attention to me, Imari starts thrusting her hips hard and breathing heavily.

[MSG$01DBF1,98]
Maybe she feels it too.  She seems to be in ecstasy, and gasps every time she takes it up the ass.

[MSG$01DC60,58]
Imari "Hey, does it feel good? It feels good, doesn't it?"

[MSG$01DCB4,50]
Imari asks me over and over again as she trembles.

[MSG$01DCEB,79]
Every time her body trembles, her well-proportioned boobs shake back and forth.

[MSG$01DD47,42]
Minase "Stop it...I think I'm gonna come."

[MSG$01DD8B,34]
Imari "Don't worry. You can come."

[MSG$01DDC7,112]
Imari "I'm gonna come too. You should come with me. Then we can forget about everything, even the bad things..."

[MSG$01DE51,34]
Imari "So don't hold it in, okay?"

[MSG$01DE8D,55]
As she speaks, I can feel my rationality slipping away.

[MSG$01DED1,65]
Minase "Aah! I can't hold back anymore...let me go. Let me come!"

[MSG$01DF2C,54]
Saeki "Heh, heh...Then you'll do what we tell you to?"

[MSG$01DF7C,56]
Minase "Yeah, I'll do anything. Just remove this thing!"

[MSG$01DFCE,13]
Saeki "Fine."

[MSG$01DFF5,72]
Saeki chuckles as I give up, and then she places her hand near my penis.

[MSG$01E04A,34]
Saeki "You want to come that bad?"

[MSG$01E086,15]
Minase "Hurry!"

[MSG$01E0AF,36]
Saeki "Then I'll let you get off..."

[MSG$01E0ED,65]
Saeki cuts the band that was wrapped around the base of my penis.

[MSG$01E1B4,14]
Band is cut...

[MSG$01E1CF,108]
My penis is swollen and was about to burst.  The band is cut, and it flies across the room with great force.

[MSG$01E248,13]
Minase "Uaa!"

[MSG$01E361,25]
White cum shooting out...

[MSG$01E387,80]
Then all the sperm that is backed up inside of me goes shooting out, into Imari.

[MSG$01E3DC,112]
At the same time, I feel an explosion of pleasure running through my body, and the room begins to fade to white.

[MSG$01E459,24]
Imari "Aah! I'm coming!"

[MSG$01E48B,68]
Imari takes my hot cock juice inside her, and reels back in ecstasy.

[MSG$01E4D4,42]
Hot, white liquid flows out of our bodies.

[MSG$01E50B,21]
Liquid pouring out...

[MSG$01E52D,71]
I shoot out everything I have inside Imari, and pass out while enjoying

[MSG$01E579,28]
the trembling aftershocks...

[MSG$01E5A2,31]
Saeki "You're one of us now..."

[MSG$01E5DB,53]
Then Saeki inserts a hypodermic needle into my arm...

[MSG$01E6AD,30]
..............................

[MSG$01E6D8,24]
........................

[MSG$01E6FD,18]
..................

[MSG$01E71C,12]
............

[MSG$01E735,6]
......

[MSG$01E748,23]
Several months later...

[MSG$01E7EC,43]
Shiraki "Aan! Good...I'm going to explode!"

[MSG$01E831,49]
Shiraki is sliding up and down on top of my cock.

[MSG$01E86F,64]
Shiraki and I are having sex, as we always do in this apartment.

[MSG$01E8B4,52]
Her stomach is getting big because of her pregnancy.

[MSG$01E8F5,68]
Maybe it's my kid. But she's had sex with so many men at this point,

[MSG$01E93E,47]
it's hard to tell who's child was inside her...

[MSG$01E97A,85]
After I fell into the grip of Ms. Kitami, I've been living as their slave ever since.

[MSG$01E9DC,107]
Then Shiraki was pulled in, and we were forced to have sex non-stop everyday like pair of mating animals...

[MSG$01EA4C,76]
Of course, we don't use any protection.  One day, Shiraki became pregnant...

[MSG$01EAA5,10]
Banging...

[MSG$01EABC,26]
Minase "I'm coming again."

[MSG$01EAF0,84]
I don't know how many times I've come, but I tell Shiraki I'm gonna screw her again.

[MSG$01EB51,37]
Shiraki "Okay, anytime you're ready!"

[MSG$01EB90,54]
Shiraki "I want you to shower my baby with your milk!"

[MSG$01EBE0,71]
Shiraki was also about to come.  She thrust down violently on my penis.

[MSG$01EC34,20]
Minase "I'm coming!"

[MSG$01EC62,17]
Shiraki "Me too!"

[MSG$01ED81,24]
White cum pouring out...

[MSG$01EDA6,46]
I shoot tons of cock juice up into her uterus.

[MSG$01EDD9,39]
Her vagina gets soaked with cock juice,

[MSG$01EE05,36]
and both our juices pour out of her.

[MSG$01EE36,38]
Shiraki "A..aah...It's flowing out..."

[MSG$01EE76,60]
Shiraki takes my thick cock juice, convulsing with pleasure.

[MSG$01EEBF,49]
Shiraki "Aan. I'm lactating...Haha..ahahahaha..."

[MSG$01EF0A,48]
White liquid is spraying out of Shiraki's boobs.

[MSG$01EF3F,50]
I watch as I enjoy the aftershocks of my orgasm...

[MSG$01EF7E,46]
I didn't really care about anything anymore...

[MSG$01EFB1,56]
Gods and devils really didn't mean much to us right now.

[MSG$01EFF6,85]
Life filled with pleasure. We wake up and have sex, then sleep a bit if we get tired.

[MSG$01F050,43]
It's the same pattern day in and day out...

[MSG$01F080,90]
The only thing that's any fun other than the sex is the drug we get several times a day...

[MSG$01F0E7,73]
Ms. Kitami disappeared all of a sudden, and Imari is in charge of us now.

[MSG$01F13D,67]
Ms. Takashiro seems to be disabled, maybe because of all the drugs.

[MSG$01F185,67]
She just lies there, a piece of flesh for the men to have fun with.

[MSG$01F1D5,48]
Soon, Shiraki and I will probably be like her...

[MSG$01F20A,68]
It's impossible to stay normal in this place, taking drugs everyday.

[MSG$01F2DC,57]
I still pray with the tiny fragment of sanity left in me.

[MSG$01F31A,86]
If there is a God, provide us with mercy and forgiveness before this gets any worse...

[MSG$01F3BB,29]
Ending No. 4 ''Rika Shiraki''

[MSG$01F3DD,6]
...End

[MSG$01F41A,18]
April 27 - Morning

[MSG$01F42F,25]
Voice "Please wake up..."

[MSG$01F462,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$01F478,31]
Voice "Um... Please wake up..."

[MSG$01F4B1,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$01F4C7,44]
Voice "What should I do? He won't get up..."

[MSG$01F50D,35]
Voice "I got it...I'll try this..."

[MSG$01F54A,8]
Grabs...

[MSG$01F55F,12]
Squeezing...

[MSG$01F578,18]
Minase "U, uun..."

[MSG$01F5A4,38]
I feel a tingling from my crotch area.

[MSG$01F5CF,45]
It feels good.  I've begun breathing heavily.

[MSG$01F601,59]
My mind gradually becomes clear as I focus on that feeling.

[MSG$01F649,100]
But the feeling of something against my crotch only becomes stronger. It's definitely not a dream...

[MSG$01F6B2,78]
I open my eyes and look up. I want to find out what's giving me this pleasure.

[MSG$01F7C0,31]
Shiraki "Ah, you're awake now?"

[MSG$01F7F9,104]
Shiraki is near the bed, wearing her school uniform.  She's got her hand on the blanket, over my crotch,

[MSG$01F866,30]
and she is stroking it gently.

[MSG$01F889,25]
No wonder it felt good...

[MSG$01F8AF,17]
Minase "Shiraki!"

[MSG$01F8DA,28]
Minase "What are you doing?"

[MSG$01F942,64]
Shiraki "Ah...I'm sorry. It's just that you wouldn't wake up..."

[MSG$01F99C,54]
Shiraki's cheeks turn red, and she withdraws her hand.

[MSG$01F9DF,74]
Shiraki "I came to wake you up. You said you needed someone to wake you up

[MSG$01FA2E,19]
|in the morning..."

[MSG$01FA5B,50]
Shiraki is glancing sheepishly at me as she talks.

[MSG$01FA9A,26]
Shiraki "Did I annoy you?"

[MSG$01FACE,26]
Minase "No, you did good."

[MSG$01FB02,35]
I thank Shiraki and get out of bed.

[MSG$01FB32,75]
This isn't bad at all. Imari was always waking me up using painful methods,

[MSG$01FB82,41]
but I'm very happy to wake up to Shiraki.

[MSG$01FBB8,71]
Seeing that Shiraki is here, I guess Imari didn't come to wake me up...

[MSG$01FC04,71]
But I guess that's to be expected, considering what happened yesterday.

[MSG$01FC58,63]
Anyway, if Shiraki wakes me up from now on, I'll be very happy.

[MSG$01FC9C,26]
Imari and I are through...

[MSG$01FCC3,41]
Shiraki "Minase, you're gonna be late..."

[MSG$01FD97,92]
Shiraki tells me to get moving, so I get my stuff quickly and we leave the house together...

[MSG$01FE00,26]
April 27 - Going to school

[MSG$01FEC8,55]
Going to school with Shiraki feels somewhat refreshing.

[MSG$01FF04,90]
Now that I think about it, I've been going to school with Imari ever since we were little.

[MSG$01FF63,45]
But I guess we won't be doing that anymore...

[MSG$01FF9D,108]
I don't have to be pushed around by Imari anymore.  Instead I'll be pushing around Shiraki and the others...

[MSG$020016,44]
In fact... Imari will be one of them soon...

[MSG$02004F,74]
I review my plans and slowly walk along the path to school with Shiraki...

[MSG$0200A6,95]
As we get closer to school, other male students see us walking together and give me cold looks.

[MSG$020112,30]
I guess they're jealous of me.

[MSG$020135,84]
I kinda want to show them... The sight of Shiraki moaning with my cock up her ass...

[MSG$020196,31]
April 27 - Front gate of school

[MSG$0202A8,76]
As we get to the front gate, I see Inoue and several others standing around.

[MSG$0202F9,102]
They seem to be waiting for someone.  They keep a close eye on the groups of students as they come in.

[MSG$02036C,92]
Everyone seems a bit unnerved by this group hanging around, and they try to hurry past them.

[MSG$0203D5,59]
I did a lot to these guys, but they haven't given up yet...

[MSG$020415,63]
I try to pass by the gate, pretending not to see them at all...

[MSG$020461,29]
Inoue "Minase. Good morning."

[MSG$020498,50]
Inoue and others see me, and bow as they approach.

[MSG$0204D7,28]
Minase "Yeah, good morning."

[MSG$02050D,40]
Inoue "Look, you have some dust on you."

[MSG$02054F,19]
Brushes off dust...

[MSG$02056F,61]
Inoue "If you need anything at all, just ask me. Heh, heh..."

[MSG$0205C6,44]
Inoue butters me up with a shit-eating grin.

[MSG$0205F7,74]
What a glib talker. But he doesn't seem to have any ill will towards me...

[MSG$02064E,25]
Minase "Yeah, all right."

[MSG$0206FD,29]
Then I pass by Inoue's group.

[MSG$02071F,21]
He's one of us now...

[MSG$020739,49]
It looks like the balance of power has shifted...

[MSG$020777,23]
April 27 - Shoe shelves

[MSG$020830,32]
Shiraki "See you later, Minase."

[MSG$02086A,14]
Minase "Yeah."

[MSG$0208B6,43]
Shiraki and I parted near the shoe shelves.

[MSG$0208E6,70]
Our first classes are far apart, so I won't be seeing her for a while.

[MSG$0209D7,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$0209EF,59]
When I approach the shelves near my classroom, I see Imari.

[MSG$020A2F,40]
Imari is staring at me with a cold look.

[MSG$020A64,44]
It's actually more like she's glaring at me.

[MSG$020A9D,24]
Minase "Good morning..."

[MSG$020ACF,21]
I try talking to her.

[MSG$020AF1,59]
Imari "Don't talk to me like we're friends. You scumbag..."

[MSG$020B46,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$020B5F,41]
I was somewhat surprised by her attitude.

[MSG$020B95,108]
She's definitely pissed...But even when we got into fights in the past, she never had this kind of attitude.

[MSG$020C06,72]
I guess what happened was especially shocking for Imari for some reason.

[MSG$020C5B,61]
Imari "You two must be very close. Enjoy your time together!"

[MSG$020CD6,56]
Imari spat out her words, then she stalked off to class.

[MSG$020D1B,16]
What the heck...

[MSG$020D30,46]
It's not like Imari and I are close like that.

[MSG$020D63,52]
I can go out with and have sex with anyone I want...

[MSG$020DA4,45]
Whatever, Imari will understand eventually...

[MSG$020DDE,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$020E71,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$020EC1,23]
Saeki "Good morning..."

[MSG$020EF2,39]
I walk into class, and Saeki greets me.

[MSG$020F26,41]
Saeki "Our Mistress was looking for you."

[MSG$020F69,37]
Minase "Looking for me? All right..."

[MSG$020FA8,39]
Saeki "She's waiting in the infirmary."

[MSG$020FE9,37]
I drop off my bag and leave the room.

[MSG$021024,25]
April 27 - Nurse's office

[MSG$0210C1,9]
Knocks...

[MSG$0210D7,20]
I knock on the door.

[MSG$0210F8,25]
Kitami "Come in, Minase."

[MSG$02112B,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0211C5,26]
I open the door and enter.

[MSG$02120A,23]
Kitami "Lock the door."

[MSG$02123B,47]
I lock the door and go to the back of the room.

[MSG$02126F,78]
I can hear the sound of a chair squeaking and heavy breathing from the back...

[MSG$02136E,30]
Kitami "Good morning, Minase."

[MSG$0213A6,13]
Minase "Ito?"

[MSG$0213CD,79]
Ms. Kitami is sitting in a chair with her huge penis jutting out of her crotch.

[MSG$021421,68]
She has it inserted into Ito's ass, which was resting on top of her.

[MSG$021472,90]
It's my first time seeing Ito since that day. The day I saw her sleeping in this office...

[MSG$0214D1,43]
Ito hasn't shown up to school since then...

[MSG$021509,17]
Ito "A..an..hya!"

[MSG$021534,86]
Each time Ito gets thrust by Ms. Kitami's penis, she lets out a heavy sigh and shakes.

[MSG$02158F,66]
Her facial expression is the same one I saw on her face back then.

[MSG$0215DE,27]
Minase "Why...is Ito here?"

[MSG$021613,78]
Kitami "You're the one who got her involved. So, I made her become one of us."

[MSG$02167B,53]
Kitami "Believe it or not, she really suspected you."

[MSG$0216CA,50]
Ms. Kitami speaks calmly as she continues her act.

[MSG$021709,52]
Minase "What? How could she know I was behind that."

[MSG$021757,80]
Kitami "Well, if rumors start getting around, everyone is going to suspect you."

[MSG$0217C1,88]
Kitami "She'd find out sooner or later. If she did, who knows what she might do to you?"

[MSG$021833,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$02184C,45]
Kitami "And that's why I told her the truth."

[MSG$021893,37]
Kitami "She looks good, doesn't she?"

[MSG$0218D2,25]
Ito does look very happy.

[MSG$0218F0,74]
Ms. Kitami probably used her magic and drugs to turn Ito into a sex slave.

[MSG$021947,32]
Kitami "Now, you wanna join in?"

[MSG$021981,100]
Kitami "You don't have to refrain. Besides, you were looking at Ito indecently just a few days ago."

[MSG$0219FF,90]
Kitami "I had a hard time cleaning up after that. Releasing all that thick, creamy cum..."

[MSG$021A73,74]
Ms. Kitami explains what happened, grinning and violating Ito as she does.

[MSG$021AC2,32]
She knew everything all along...

[MSG$021AEF,70]
Kitami "Now, show her what you're made of. Then, Ito will understand."

[MSG$021B4F,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$021B68,45]
Kitami "Hey, ask him to give it to you, Ito."

[MSG$021BAF,51]
Ito "Please. Stick your thing inside me, Minase..."

[MSG$021C0A,59]
After hearing what Ito has to say, I walk up to her slowly.

[MSG$021C52,43]
I feel sorry for Ito, but I have no choice.

[MSG$021C82,31]
I must reap what I have sown...

[MSG$021CAE,98]
Kitami "Heh, heh...it looks like you're ready to do it. Now I want you to block up that vagina..."

[MSG$021D2A,82]
I placed the head of my penis up against her vagina, and slowly slide it inside...

[MSG$021E02,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$021E1B,12]
Ito "Haaaa!"

[MSG$021E41,47]
My cock went up inside her wet vagina smoothly.

[MSG$021E7D,59]
The inside of her is hot, and it wraps all around my penis.

[MSG$021EBD,107]
Ms. Kitami's huge penis lodged up Ito's ass.  It puts pressure against my penis through Ito's vaginal wall.

[MSG$021F35,32]
Kitami "Now, let's get serious."

[MSG$021F6F,10]
Banging...

[MSG$021F86,46]
Ms. Kitami and I started thrusting inside Ito.

[MSG$021FC1,31]
Ito "Hauu! Great...it's great!"

[MSG$021FFA,58]
Ms. Kitami and I thrust Ito rhythmically, again and again.

[MSG$022039,88]
Every time Ms. Kitami thrusts, her cock puts pressure against the walls of Ito's vagina,

[MSG$022096,53]
and I feel a strong sensation at the tip of my penis.

[MSG$0220D8,84]
Ito "Aan! So great...Dr. Kitami and Minase's hard cocks are running wild inside me!"

[MSG$022146,49]
We sandwiched Ito and thrust over and over again.

[MSG$02217C,76]
The sound of us banging her echoed throughout the small office we were in...

[MSG$0221D5,80]
At first, Ito seems confused by getting banged both from the front and the back.

[MSG$02222A,95]
Soon she gets used to the rhythm, she starts to breathe heavily and move her hips on her own...

[MSG$022296,40]
After a moment, I feel the urge to come.

[MSG$0222CB,46]
Minase "Ms. Kitami, I'm about to shoot off..."

[MSG$022313,72]
Kitami "So quick...All right, I was just thinking of climaxing as well."

[MSG$022375,77]
Then Ms. Kitami and I decided to thrust deep into Ito with everything we had.

[MSG$0223CF,10]
Banging...

[MSG$0223E6,75]
Ito was taking our vicious thrusts, and looked like she was about to faint.

[MSG$022436,83]
We kept on thrusting her with speed and force, we didn't care if we tore her apart.

[MSG$022496,40]
Ito "Nua! Hau! I'm coming...I'm coming!"

[MSG$0224D8,22]
Kitami "Here it goes!"

[MSG$022508,12]
Minase "Uh!"

[MSG$02252F,17]
Ito "I'm coming!"

[MSG$02264D,27]
Cock juice squirting out...

[MSG$022675,32]
More cock juice squirting out...

[MSG$0226A2,74]
Ms. Kitami and I both released our hot liquid inside Ito at the same time.

[MSG$0226F1,70]
My mind was blank, I just filled up her uterus with my river of cum...

[MSG$022744,61]
Ito "It's flowing...it's entering my body from both holes..."

[MSG$02279B,58]
Ito takes the juices up inside her as her body twitches...

[MSG$0227DA,63]
Ms. Kitami and I ejaculated again and again without letting up.

[MSG$022826,28]
Kitami "That was great Ito."

[MSG$02285C,26]
Ito "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$022890,72]
After we finished ejaculating, we pulled out our penises from her holes.

[MSG$02295E,14]
Pulling out...

[MSG$022979,24]
Cock juice coming out...

[MSG$02299E,38]
Ms. Kitami and I pull out our penises,

[MSG$0229C9,32]
and thick white liquid pours out

[MSG$0229EE,25]
from both Ito's openings.

[MSG$022A14,53]
Kitami "Phew...How did that feel, Minase? Satisfied?"

[MSG$022A63,15]
Minase "Yes..."

[MSG$022A8C,68]
Kitami "You should be happy, Ito. You sucked up so much cock juice."

[MSG$022AEA,61]
White liquid keeps pouring and pouring out of Ito's openings.

[MSG$022B34,32]
Ito "Yes...Thank you, Minase..."

[MSG$022B6E,64]
Maybe Ito is still feeling the orgasm, as her body is trembling.

[MSG$022C49,74]
Ms. Kitami throws Ito on the bed roughly, and quickly goes to get dressed.

[MSG$022CAE,79]
Ms. Kitami and I greet each other calmly and prepare to get down to business...

[MSG$022D86,70]
Kitami "Now, the reason I called you out is because of Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$022DE6,32]
Kitami "She's been on our tail."

[MSG$022E20,23]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$022E51,56]
Kitami "She's a survivor from the coven of 12 years ago.

[MSG$022E8E,72]
She bailed out just before the ritual, and didn't participate at all..."

[MSG$022EF0,92]
Kitami "She is starting to suspect we're up to something. I'm sure she'll try and stop us...

[MSG$022F51,11]
Very soon."

[MSG$022F76,90]
Kitami "However, she doesn't realize I'm behind this whole thing. If she does make a move,

[MSG$022FD5,88]
she'll come after you first because of the book. You know what will happen then, right?"

[MSG$023047,24]
Minase "But how do I..."

[MSG$023079,71]
Kitami "That's up to you. You have the powers to decide your own fate."

[MSG$0230DA,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$023109,84]
Kitami "She has magic, even though she's weak. The power I gave you is not complete.

[MSG$023162,89]
Your magic will have very little effect against someone as experienced as Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$0231D5,100]
Kitami "Use your head. If you can get her to join us, then nobody will be able to stand in our way."

[MSG$023253,82]
Kitami "Ms. Takashiro is definitely coming after the book. I'm counting on you..."

[MSG$0232C0,22]
Minase "I understand."

[MSG$0232F0,91]
Kitami "That woman is worth fighting for. I'm sure she'll entertain us once we have her..."

[MSG$02337E,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$02348A,17]
The bell rings...

[MSG$0234A8,36]
The bell sounds, and class begins...

[MSG$02355D,30]
..............................

[MSG$023588,24]

[MSG$0235AD,18]

[MSG$0235E5,6]

[MSG$0235F8,97]
Lunch went by just like my morning class, and soon my afternoon classes came to an end as well...

[MSG$023666,23]
April 27 - After school

[MSG$023704,50]
I leave my seat, clean my desk, and exit the room.

[MSG$02373B,50]
I'm supposed to go to the apartment again today...

[MSG$0237F6,90]
At times like this, I'm happy that I've been released form Imari's grasp. If she's around,

[MSG$023855,52]
then I'd be forced to go to the art club with her...

[MSG$0238C8,19]
Shiraki "Minase..."

[MSG$0238F5,55]
Shiraki was standing out in the hallway, holding a bag.

[MSG$023939,33]
Shiraki "Can I go home with you?"

[MSG$023974,14]
Minase "Sure."

[MSG$023A19,74]
Free from Imari, I start walking home with Shiraki.  It feels pretty good.

[MSG$023A68,60]
It's not a bad idea to walk home with Shiraki from now on...

[MSG$023AB1,99]
We go down the stairs, and head towards the shoe shelves. I notice someone standing in front of me.

[MSG$023BC8,25]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro..."

[MSG$023BFB,79]
Ms. Takashiro stands in front of me, almost as if she's trying to block my way.

[MSG$023C57,46]
Takashiro "Can you come with me for a second?"

[MSG$023C9F,66]
Ms. Takashiro is glaring at me and speaking with ice in her voice.

[MSG$023CE6,73]
Her words are filled with authority. I decide to do what she tells me to.

[MSG$023DB9,46]
I follow Ms. Takashiro into a vacant art room.

[MSG$023DEC,70]
Shiraki looks at me with some uneasiness, and then follows me quietly.

[MSG$023E3F,19]
April 27 - Art room

[MSG$023EF4,26]
Minase "What do you want?"

[MSG$023F28,61]
We face each other and I ask her before she can say anything.

[MSG$023F72,51]
Of course, I already know what Ms. Takashiro wants.

[MSG$023FAA,73]
Just like Ms. Kitami said, Ms. Takashiro is trying to put pressure on me.

[MSG$024000,75]
Takashiro "I suggest that you remove yourself from that group immediately."

[MSG$024065,36]
Minase "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$0240A3,73]
She's saying exactly what I expected, but I pretend not to know anything.

[MSG$0240F9,30]
Takashiro "Don't sidestep me!"

[MSG$024131,65]
Takashiro "You people are trying to do something with that book!"

[MSG$02418C,63]
Minase "Book? Do you know how dumb that sounds, Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$0241E5,52]
Takashiro "So you're going to play stupid, are you?"

[MSG$024233,19]
Takashiro "Then..."

[MSG$024260,5]
Bang!

[MSG$024272,92]
Ms. Takashiro mutters under her breath.  She approaches me and snatches my bag from my hand.

[MSG$0242DB,13]
Minase "Wha?"

[MSG$024302,66]
She opens up the bag in front of me, and pulls out the magic book.

[MSG$024351,80]
Takashiro "What's this? Are you still going to pretend you don't know anything?"

[MSG$0243BB,31]
Minase "Please give that back."

[MSG$0243F4,29]
I'm glaring at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02441E,32]
Takashiro "No. I can't do that."

[MSG$024458,41]
Takashiro "I don't know how you got this,

[MSG$024486,33]
but you shouldn't use this power.

[MSG$0244AC,48]
If you do, it's only going to lead to disaster."

[MSG$0244F7,24]
Minase "Give it back..."

[MSG$024529,65]
Takashiro "Wake up. It's not too late!  You can still turn back."

[MSG$024584,23]
Minase "Give it to me!"

[MSG$0245B5,47]
I release my power, aiming it at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$024716,4]
Bam!

[MSG$024727,19]
Takashiro "Kyaaaa!"

[MSG$024754,100]
Ms. Takashiro is blown back by my magic.  She falls down to her knees and she knocks over the easel.

[MSG$0247C5,120]
She stays on the floor for a moment.  She looks shocked, but she shakes her head and gets up as she comes to her senses.

[MSG$02487C,83]
Takashiro "You've become a follower...But how did you get that kind of evil power?"

[MSG$0248E9,58]
Minase "Now you know who I am. Give that back to me, now!"

[MSG$02493D,22]
Takashiro "No. Never!"

[MSG$02496E,74]
Takashiro "You don't know anything...Do you want history to repeat itself?

[MSG$0249BD,47]
Do you want it to be like it was 12 years ago?"

[MSG$024A06,80]
Takashiro "Humans can't control the dark power. If you aid the devil in any way,

[MSG$024A5B,27]
you're going to regret it!"

[MSG$024A90,115]
Minase "If you're not gonna give it back, I'll take it from you by force...This time, I won't take it easy on you."

[MSG$024B1D,30]
I aim at Ms. Takashiro slowly.

[MSG$024B48,84]
Takashiro "I guess it's no use talking to you. I'm afraid you leave me no choice..."

[MSG$024BB6,51]
Takashiro "IKZHIKAL..EDLPRNAA..BATAIVAH.. RAAGIOSL.

[MSG$024BEE,66]
Behold the four flaming pentagrams as I stand alone in the midst!"

[MSG$024C4A,84]
Ms. Takashiro recites some kind of spell, and a star symbol appears in front of her.

[MSG$024CAB,19]
Minase "Take this!"

[MSG$024CD8,6]
Crack!

[MSG$024D8A,80]
I launch my power, but it breaks and turns to dust before Ms. Takashiro's spell.

[MSG$024DE7,20]
Minase "What the..."

[MSG$024E15,91]
Takashiro "You shouldn't get overconfident just because an evil imp has been bound to you."

[MSG$024E8A,16]
Minase "Damn..."

[MSG$024EB4,71]
Takashiro "I'll get rid of this book. It shouldn't exist in this world.

[MSG$024F00,47]
I have to burn it before more people suffer..."

[MSG$024F49,74]
Takashiro "But tell me, what are you people planning to do?  This power...

[MSG$024F98,39]
it's not something that's easy to get."

[MSG$024FD9,58]
Takashiro "I can't just let you go now that I've seen it."

[MSG$02502D,28]
Ms. Takashiro approaches me.

[MSG$0250AC,23]
Shiraki "Please don't!"

[MSG$0250DD,7]
Stab...

[MSG$0250F1,14]
Takashiro "!?"

[MSG$025119,74]
Shiraki jumps out from behind me, and attacks Ms. Takashiro as she shouts.

[MSG$025168,54]
Ms. Takashiro can't evade Shiraki's surprise attack...

[MSG$0251AB,92]
Shiraki has a hypodermic needle in her hand, and it sticks deep inside Ms. Takashiro's body.

[MSG$025214,68]
Ms. Takashiro looks at the needle stuck in her body.  She's shocked.

[MSG$02525D,116]
Shiraki must have released the contents at the moment of insertion, the liquid inside the hypodermic needle is gone.

[MSG$0252DE,29]
Takashiro "Shiraki! You too?"

[MSG$025315,49]
Suddenly, Ms. Takashiro's legs start to give out.

[MSG$025353,32]
Shiraki "Stop confusing Minase."

[MSG$02538D,53]
Shiraki grabs on to me, as she berates Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$0253CF,77]
Ms. Takashiro pulls out the needle from her body, and throws it on the floor.

[MSG$025421,72]
Ms. Kitami probably gave that hypodermic needle to Shiraki beforehand...

[MSG$025476,36]
Takashiro "What...did you do to me?"

[MSG$0254B4,18]
Takashiro "Ugh..."

[MSG$025564,17]
She falls down...

[MSG$025582,91]
Ms. Takashiro tries to hold on, but then she suddenly looks up and drops down to the floor.

[MSG$025689,53]
Shiraki "I'm sorry. I just couldn't watch anymore..."

[MSG$0256D8,31]
Shiraki is speaking hesitantly.

[MSG$025704,16]
Minase "Thanks."

[MSG$02572E,54]
If it weren't for Shiraki, I would've been defeated...

[MSG$025769,15]
I kiss Shiraki.

[MSG$025785,86]
Minase "You go and get Ms. Kitami. I'll tie up Ms. Takashiro, so that she can't move."

[MSG$0257F5,17]
Shiraki "Okay..."

[MSG$02589C,72]
As Shiraki leaves the art room, I tie up Ms. Takashiro's hands and feet.

[MSG$0258E9,43]
Shiraki comes back quickly with Ms. Kitami.

[MSG$025921,32]
Kitami "I see things went well."

[MSG$02595B,45]
Minase "What shall we do with Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$0259A2,67]
Kitami "We'll take her to the apartment. Then, I'll entertain her."

[MSG$0259FF,54]
Kitami "It looks like it's going to be a fun night..."

[MSG$025A4F,34]
Ms. Kitami is grinning ear to ear.

[MSG$025A7E,73]
Kitami "I'm going to get the car and take Ms. Takashiro to the apartment.

[MSG$025ACC,91]
You two stop by the apartment later. Tonight we'll have a welcome party for Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$025B41,22]
Minase "I understand."

[MSG$025B71,54]
Ms. Kitami picks up Ms. Takashiro and leaves the room.

[MSG$025BB4,85]
I pick up the book Ms. Takashiro dropped, clean the art room, and leave with Shiraki.

[MSG$025C7E,25]
April 27 - Leaving school

[MSG$025D41,85]
Tonight, Ms. Takashiro becomes our prey...I'm getting excited just thinking about it.

[MSG$025D9B,69]
I'm getting hard picturing the resolute Ms. Takashiro all dirtied up.

[MSG$025DED,43]
Shiraki "You're going there again tonight?"

[MSG$025E32,40]
Minase "Yeah. You're coming too, right?"

[MSG$025E74,16]
Shiraki "Yes..."

[MSG$025E9E,42]
Shiraki seems a bit puzzled, but she nods.

[MSG$025ED5,59]
Shiraki "Then I'll just go home and get changed quickly..."

[MSG$025F2A,47]
Minase "Why don't we just head over there now?"

[MSG$025F73,16]
Shiraki "But..."

[MSG$025F9D,35]
Minase "All right...Make it quick."

[MSG$025FDA,15]
Shiraki "Okay."

[MSG$026027,43]
Shiraki and I part, and she heads for home.

[MSG$026057,53]
Well, I'm sure girls have a lot of things going on...

[MSG$026099,41]
I head over to the apartment by myself...

[MSG$0260F3,48]
Something happened after Shiraki and I parted...

[MSG$026130,20]
Voice "Taki Minase!"

[MSG$02615E,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$026185,62]
I quickly turn around to see where the voice is coming from...

[MSG$0262DA,7]
Stab...

[MSG$0262EE,10]
Minase:!?"

[MSG$026312,72]
I feel something hit me, and all of a sudden my chest hurts like hell...

[MSG$026367,81]
The area around my heart is hot, and I can hear my heartbeats echoing in my head.

[MSG$0263BD,82]
The handle of a knife is sticking out of my chest. The blade is buried in my body.

[MSG$02641C,20]
Minase "What the..."

[MSG$02644A,57]
Before I can say anything, my shirt starts to turn red...

[MSG$026488,57]
Shit! This is no joke, there's a knife stuck in my chest!

[MSG$0264CE,47]
Ito "Die, Minase! Die and atone for your sins!"

[MSG$026517,60]
Ito is standing in front of me wearing her school uniform...

[MSG$026560,13]
Minase "Ito?"

[MSG$026587,26]
Ito "Well...does it hurt?"

[MSG$0265BB,74]
Ito "I'm sure it hurts. But your pain is nothing compared to what I felt."

[MSG$02661F,75]
Ito "Because of you, I was forced to denigrate myself in front of everyone.

[MSG$02666F,74]
How do you expect me to live after such a revolting thing happened to me?"

[MSG$0266D3,80]
Minase "You stupid bitch...You expect me to die just because I embarrassed you?"

[MSG$02673D,73]
Every time I breathe, it feels like I'm being stabbed in the chest again.

[MSG$02678B,28]
This is really bad...Why me?

[MSG$0267B4,66]
Ito "Embarrassed? Shut your hole! How could you say such a thing?"

[MSG$026810,94]
Ito "Since that day, I've thought about nothing but killing myself. Only I wasn't satisfied...

[MSG$026873,32]
I can't just die for no reason."

[MSG$0268AD,116]
Ito "Then I heard a rumor about you going around, and it suddenly hit me. You must have planned what happened to me.

[MSG$026926,24]
Isn'that right, Minase?"

[MSG$026958,30]
Minase "Hah...hah...gha! Gha!"

[MSG$026990,54]
My chest feels hot, and I'm spitting blood as I cough.

[MSG$0269CB,55]
Along with air, I cough thick blood up from my mouth...

[MSG$026A07,41]
I don't even have enough energy to speak.

[MSG$026A3D,39]
Ito "So I decided I should kill you..."

[MSG$026A7E,27]
Minase "You're... crazy..."

[MSG$026AB3,52]
Ito "It wouldn't be fair if I died and you lived..."

[MSG$026B01,26]
Ito "So you should die..."

[MSG$026B35,57]
Ito reaches forward and pulls the out knife from my body.

[MSG$026BF8,47]
Rivers of blood pour out from the gaping wound.

[MSG$026C2C,66]
As the red liquid splashes to the ground, I feel my legs give out.

[MSG$026C7B,13]
Falls down...

[MSG$026C95,18]
Minase "Gha! Gha!"

[MSG$026CC1,64]
I cough up more blood from my mouth and roll over on the ground.

[MSG$026D06,57]
I'm losing consciousness, and my vision is fading fast...

[MSG$026D9D,76]
Ito "You look like you're suffering...There's no way you can survive now..."

[MSG$026E03,40]
I can only hear Ito's sneering comments.

[MSG$026E38,59]
Ito "You should think about what you did, and die in pain."

[MSG$026E8D,57]
Ito "You deserve to die. It serves you right, ahahahaha!"

[MSG$026EE0,14]
Drops knife...

[MSG$026EFB,12]
Ito "Heh..."

[MSG$026F72,48]
Ito throws away the knife, and leaves me behind.

[MSG$026FA7,24]
There's nobody around...

[MSG$026FCC,47]
I can only hear the footsteps of Ito leaving...

[MSG$027008,27]
Nobody's gonna notice me...

[MSG$027028,25]
Am I gonna die like this?

[MSG$027046,81]
I'm fading in and out.  If I can't concentrate, Black Magic will do me no good...

[MSG$0270A4,66]
With my consciousness fading away, Imari's image comes to my mind.

[MSG$0270EB,60]
I regret what I did. I ditched Imari and joined the devil...

[MSG$027134,55]
That book controlled me. If it weren't for that book...

[MSG$027178,37]
Then my memories turn to blackness...

[MSG$0271CA,28]
Ending No. 8 ''On the road''

[MSG$0271EB,10]
...Bad End

[MSG$02722C,20]
April 27 - Apartment

[MSG$02732F,52]
I arrive at the apartment and head for the elevator.

[MSG$027368,41]
Ms. Kitami's car is parked in the garage.

[MSG$02741A,69]
I get off the elevator, walk down the hallway, and head for the room.

[MSG$027464,52]
I wonder if Saeki and the others are here already...

[MSG$0274A5,17]
Rings doorbell...

[MSG$0274C3,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0274E1,52]
The door swings open as soon as I ring the doorbell.

[MSG$0275C2,55]
Kurimoto "You're quick. Come on in, we're ready to go."

[MSG$027613,41]
Kurimoto greets me at the front entrance.

[MSG$027641,45]
I enter the room and lock the door behind me.

[MSG$02767B,77]
Kurimoto and I walk down the dim hallway and go to the back of the main room.

[MSG$027752,23]
Kitami "You're here..."

[MSG$027783,59]
There are several people other than Ms. Kitami in the room.

[MSG$0277C3,81]
Inoue is one of them. There's also a bunch of other guys, none who I really know.

[MSG$027821,38]
Ms. Kitami may have brought them here,

[MSG$02784C,116]
but they seem a little uncomfortable, all hanging out in the corner of the room wearing nothing but their underwear.

[MSG$0278CD,81]
I'm sure these guys were brought here by Ms. Kitami to entertain Ms. Takashiro...

[MSG$0279CE,70]
In the center of the room, is Ms. Takashiro tied up in an obscene way.

[MSG$027A21,99]
Her hands and feet are tied to a chair, and are secured tight so that she wouldn't be able to move.

[MSG$027A89,61]
Her mouth is gagged, probably so she can't recite any spells.

[MSG$027AD3,112]
I look closely and see that her eyes are still shut.  Her chest moves up and down with slow, measured breathing,

[MSG$027B48,45]
and it doesn't look like she resisted at all.

[MSG$027B82,30]
Minase "She's still sleeping?"

[MSG$027BBA,73]
Kitami "Yes. I'm sure she'll be surprised when she regains consciousness.

[MSG$027C08,43]
She's probably not used to that position...

[MSG$027C38,12]
Heh, heh..."

[MSG$027C5E,66]
Kitami "Let's begin, shall we? It's boring to just wait around..."

[MSG$027CBA,40]
Minase "You're not gonna use the drugs?"

[MSG$027CFC,82]
Kitami "Using the drug makes things easier, but that would take away all the fun."

[MSG$027D68,108]
Ms. Kitami smiles mysteriously. Ms. Kitami is gonna have fun with Ms. Takashiro until she falls to pieces...

[MSG$027DE1,72]
Ms. Kitami approaches Ms. Takashiro, and strokes her crotch and breasts.

[MSG$027E36,30]
Kitami "Now...entertain me..."

[MSG$027E6F,54]
Ms. Kitami takes one of the candles lighting the room,

[MSG$027EAA,44]
and approaches Ms. Takashiro's clean body...

[MSG$027EE3,74]
The candle wax starts to melt, and spills over Ms. Takashiro's white skin.

[MSG$027F3A,22]
Candle wax dripping...

[MSG$027FE6,18]
Takashiro "Ngg..."

[MSG$028012,69]
Ms. Takashiro shakes and moans as the candle wax drips onto her body.

[MSG$02805C,75]
But she's pretty far gone.  She won't regain consciousness from this alone.

[MSG$0280B4,65]
Ms. Kitami grins and keeps dripping red wax onto Ms. Takashiro...

[MSG$02818B,22]
Dripping candle wax...

[MSG$0281AE,22]
Takashiro "Un..fuu..."

[MSG$0281DE,112]
Ms. Takashiro moans each time the wax drips onto her body. But her sensitive parts are covered by her underwear,

[MSG$028253,48]
and the wax isn't painful enough to wake her up.

[MSG$028288,85]
The wax hardens once it touches her skin, and covers her clean white skin with red...

[MSG$0282EA,56]
After a while, her skin has been showered with red dots.

[MSG$02832F,45]
Kitami "Now, it's time for her to wake up..."

[MSG$028376,57]
Ms. Kitami places her hands on Ms. Takashiro's underwear.

[MSG$028445,72]
She first rips off her bra and exposes Ms. Takashiro's voluptuous boobs.

[MSG$028492,72]
Her soft boobs pop out and sway from the force of her bra being removed.

[MSG$0284E7,118]
Then Ms. Kitami gets a good grip on her panties, and cuts them off with a knife after pulling them tight up her pussy.

[MSG$0285E3,87]
Her panties rolled up with the force of release, and Ms. Takashiro's vagina is exposed.

[MSG$028647,58]
Kitami "Looks like you haven't been using it much lately."

[MSG$02869B,65]
Ms. Kitami speaks gently as she examines the softly raised mound.

[MSG$0286E9,36]
You can clearly see a pinkish labia.

[MSG$028712,39]
I'm getting excited just looking at it.

[MSG$028746,31]
Kitami "Heh, heh...Here we go."

[MSG$02877F,55]
Ms. Kitami holds the candle over Ms. Takashiro's chest.

[MSG$0287C3,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$028868,21]
Takashiro "Ugh..uuh!"

[MSG$028897,77]
Wax keeps dripping onto her nipples and breasts, and they turn red with it.

[MSG$0288F1,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$02890D,93]
To lessen the heat of the wax, Ms. Kitami lets it drip from the top of the candle on purpose.

[MSG$02896F,72]
Ms. Takashiro reacts to the wax, but still doesn't regain consciousness.

[MSG$0289C4,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$028A69,77]
Now her boobs were covered to the point where you can't even see her nipples.

[MSG$028AC3,54]
Kitami "This time, you're definitely gonna wake up..."

[MSG$028B13,64]
Ms. Kitami moves her hand down to Ms. Takashiro's crotch area...

[MSG$028B60,24]
Kitami "Now, wake up..."

[MSG$028B92,26]
Then she tilts the candle.

[MSG$028BB9,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$028C5E,18]
Takashiro "Higuu!"

[MSG$028C8A,79]
As the wax touches her crotch, Ms. Takashiro tries to leap forward in surprise.

[MSG$028CDE,65]
But since her body is tied to a chair, she's pulled back roughly.

[MSG$028D2C,17]
Takashiro "Uuuu!"

[MSG$028D57,98]
Ms. Takashiro is forced awake.  Her eyes bug out in shock as she realizes what's happening to her.

[MSG$028DBE,109]
I guess that's no surprise. Anyone would be shocked to find themselves in her situation just after waking up.

[MSG$028E38,64]
Kitami "You're awake...That's a great way to wake up, isn't it?"

[MSG$028E92,77]
Ms. Kitami chuckles at Ms. Takashiro, who doesn't understand what's going on.

[MSG$028EEC,87]
Ms. Takashiro watches in blank surprise as Ms. Kitami holds the candle in front of her.

[MSG$028F50,72]
Kitami "You can't figure out why I'm here or why I'm doing this, right?"

[MSG$028FB2,24]
Takashiro "Uuuu! Uuuuu!"

[MSG$028FE4,70]
Kitami "Well, I'll fill you in later. So just bear with me for now..."

[MSG$029044,61]
Ms. Kitami continues to drip wax onto Ms. Takashiro's crotch.

[MSG$02908E,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$029133,19]
Takashiro "Uguuuu!"

[MSG$029160,95]
Wax keeps dripping onto Ms. Takashiro's pussy, and she starts to thrash back and forth in pain.

[MSG$0291C4,68]
But Ms. Kitami doesn't seem to care.  She keeps on dripping hot wax.

[MSG$029215,15]
Wax dripping...

[MSG$029231,23]
Takashiro "Higuu! Guh!"

[MSG$029262,70]
Ms. Takashiro's crotch is all red, and wax covers up most of her skin.

[MSG$0292AD,86]
Ms. Takashiro seems to calm down, as if she's getting used to the heat from the wax...

[MSG$029310,46]
Kitami "Now, isn't that beautiful? Ahahahaha!"

[MSG$029358,82]
Ms. Kitami looks over the red wax covering Ms. Takashiro's body and ridicules her.

[MSG$0293B7,23]
Takashiro "Uu..higu..."

[MSG$0293E8,52]
Kitami "All right, let's get that wax off of you..."

[MSG$029436,59]
Ms. Kitami grins and places her hand on a chunk of red wax.

[MSG$029476,63]
Then she starts to remove the wax from Ms. Takashiro's breasts.

[MSG$0294C2,56]
Ms. Takashiro quietly waits as the wax is being removed.

[MSG$0294FF,71]
All the wax is pulled off, except for the wax on Ms. Takashiro's pussy.

[MSG$0295CD,82]
Lastly, Ms. Kitami places her hand lovingly on Ms. Takashiro's wax-covered crotch.

[MSG$02962C,59]
Kitami "Oh, look.  One more piece to clean up. Heh, heh..."

[MSG$029682,17]
Takashiro "Unnn!"

[MSG$0296AE,82]
Ms. Takashiro realizes what Ms. Kitami is about to do, and she starts to struggle.

[MSG$02970D,15]
Removing wax...

[MSG$0297B2,19]
Takashiro "Ungaaa!"

[MSG$0297DF,91]
Since the wax is covering her pubic hairs, every time Ms. Kitami gives a little pull on it,

[MSG$02983F,40]
a disturbing tearing sound can be heard.

[MSG$02986C,114]
Ms. Takashiro's pubic hair is growing in one direction, but Ms. Kitami pulls up the wax in the opposite direction.

[MSG$0298EB,84]
Ms. Takashiro is teary eyed because of the pain, and her body whole body is shaking.

[MSG$02994C,98]
After the wax has been removed, Ms. Takashiro's crotch is perfectly smooth and swollen cherry red.

[MSG$0299BB,80]
Kitami "I'm sorry. I must have pulled it off in the wrong direction. Ahahahaha!"

[MSG$029A25,56]
Ms. Kitami examines Ms. Takashiro's crotch and chuckles.

[MSG$029A62,95]
Ms. Takashiro has no choice but to take the pain and embarrassment.  Tears run down her cheeks.

[MSG$029ACE,60]
Kitami "Now, I'll stick my big dick into that clean vagina."

[MSG$029B24,82]
Ms. Kitami puts her fingers on either side of her slit and pulls out a huge penis.

[MSG$029B83,16]
Takashiro "Unn!"

[MSG$029BAD,58]
Ms. Takashiro is surprised by Ms. Kitami's enormous penis.

[MSG$029BEC,90]
I don't blame her. Anyone would be surprised to see a penis growing out of a woman's body.

[MSG$029C53,51]
Kitami "Look at this. It wants to enter your body."

[MSG$029CA0,58]
Ms. Kitami's penis throbs with the sound of her heartbeat.

[MSG$029CE7,16]
Takashiro "Uuu!"

[MSG$029D11,104]
Ms. Takashiro shook her head vigorously side to side as Ms. Kitami's penis approaches her smooth vagina.

[MSG$029D7E,57]
But Ms. Takashiro is all tied up, and has no place to go.

[MSG$029DC4,22]
Kitami "Here we go..."

[MSG$029DF4,94]
Ms. Kitami presses the head of the penis against her slit, and pushes her hips forward slowly.

[MSG$029E5F,41]
Little by little, Ms. Kitami's penis digs

[MSG$029E8D,31]
|into Ms. Takashiro's vagina...

[MSG$029F32,16]
Takashiro "Ung!"

[MSG$029F5C,48]
Ms. Kitami's penis is buried all the way inside.

[MSG$029F91,59]
Everyone in the room can clearly see them have intercourse.

[MSG$029FD9,47]
Kitami "So good...It feels so good inside you."

[MSG$02A022,10]
Banging...

[MSG$02A039,56]
Ms. Kitami thrusts her hips back and forth rhythmically.

[MSG$02A076,68]
Ms. Takashiro's boobs bounce up and down every time she gets thrust.

[MSG$02A0C7,45]
Bodily fluids are oozing out from her vagina.

[MSG$02A101,29]
Takashiro "Ugh..guh..higu..."

[MSG$02A138,102]
Ms. Takashiro is being violated in front of everyone, but she puts up with the pain and embarrassment.

[MSG$02A1A3,85]
The others are getting excited because of the obscene act act right in front of them.

[MSG$02A1FD,41]
Some of them are playing with themselves.

[MSG$02A233,10]
Banging...

[MSG$02A24A,50]
Since Ms. Takashiro is tied up, she can't help but

[MSG$02A281,36]
feel the full force of every thrust.

[MSG$02A2B2,47]
Her cheeks turn pink, and her nipples are hard.

[MSG$02A2EE,73]
Ms. Kitami increases the speed little by little, she's getting excited...

[MSG$02A344,27]
Kitami "I'm about to come."

[MSG$02A379,16]
Takashiro "Uuu!"

[MSG$02A3A3,52]
Kitami "What? You don't want me to come inside you?"

[MSG$02A3F1,43]
Ms. Takashiro shakes her head side to side.

[MSG$02A429,50]
Kitami "Then I'll be sure to shoot it all inside."

[MSG$02A475,17]
Takashiro "Higu!"

[MSG$02A4A0,72]
Ms. Takashiro sheds tears as she hears Ms. Kitami's cruel determination.

[MSG$02A4F5,23]
Kitami "Here I come..."

[MSG$02A526,71]
Ms. Kitami thrusts with her hips, faster and faster and reaches climax.

[MSG$02A57A,13]
Kitami "Aah!"

[MSG$02A61A,25]
Thick cum shooting out...

[MSG$02A640,46]
Ms. Kitami stops moving her hips and convulses

[MSG$02A673,52]
as she pours lots of liquid up inside Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02A6B4,16]
Takashiro "Uuu!"

[MSG$02A6DE,65]
Ms. Takashiro takes the hot liquid inside her.  She looks pained.

[MSG$02A72C,42]
She is totally under Ms. Kitami's control.

[MSG$02A75B,51]
And she will be driven to insanity. Just like us...

[MSG$02A79B,25]
Cock juice pouring out...

[MSG$02A7C1,80]
After Ms. Kitami releases her entire white load, she slowly pulls out her penis.

[MSG$02A897,14]
Pulling out...

[MSG$02A8B2,77]
After Ms. Kitami pulls out, white liquid pours out of Ms. Takashiro's vagina.

[MSG$02A90C,35]
Kitami "I did say I'd fill you in."

[MSG$02A949,81]
Ms. Takashiro looks relieved that the act is over. She relaxes against her chair.

[MSG$02A99F,47]
But I'm certain Ms. Kitami isn't through yet...

[MSG$02A9DB,68]
Kitami "It's too early for you to relax. There's plenty more to go."

[MSG$02AA39,14]
Takashiro "!?"

[MSG$02AA61,34]
Ms. Takashiro opens her eyes wide.

[MSG$02AA90,36]
Kitami "Now, it's your turn Minase."

[MSG$02AACE,32]
I slowly approach Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02AAFB,19]
Takashiro "U..uu.."

[MSG$02AB28,45]
Ms. Takashiro is looking at me with sad eyes.

[MSG$02AB5A,65]
I have a guilty conscience, but it's too late to be worrying now.

[MSG$02ABA8,69]
After watching Ms. Takashiro's performance, my cock was already erect

[MSG$02ABF2,25]
|and ready for insertion.

[MSG$02AC18,18]
I take out my cock

[MSG$02AC2F,43]
and lay it against Ms. Takashiro's abdomen.

[MSG$02AC67,39]
Minase "I'm going in, Ms. Takashiro..."

[MSG$02ACA8,69]
I place my cock against her opening and insert it all the way inside.

[MSG$02AD73,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$02AD8C,85]
My cock enters inside quickly due to all the slick liquid Ms. Kitami released inside.

[MSG$02ADE6,91]
As it goes deep up her, liquid inside her vagina pours out from her crevice around my cock.

[MSG$02AE4E,38]
Inside it is hot and slippery as hell.

[MSG$02AE81,69]
Kitami "How does it feel to have your student inside you, professor?"

[MSG$02AEE0,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$02AEFC,59]
Kitami "You seem to like it. With your nipples all hard..."

[MSG$02AF51,18]
Takashiro "Kuh..."

[MSG$02AF7D,56]
Ms. Takashiro is quiet and trembling with embarrassment.

[MSG$02AFBA,48]
Even if she wants to speak, she can only moan...

[MSG$02AFF7,79]
Kitami "Start moving, Minase. If you ejaculate, do it inside. Just like I did."

[MSG$02B060,42]
Ms. Takashiro doesn't show any resistance.

[MSG$02B08F,24]
She's probably given up.

[MSG$02B0B4,54]
I start moving my hips as I thrust into Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02B0F7,10]
Banging...

[MSG$02B10E,62]
Inside Ms. Takashiro it is hot, sticky, and feels really good.

[MSG$02B159,25]
I keep on moving my hips.

[MSG$02B17F,26]
Kitami "Good, keep going."

[MSG$02B1B3,29]
Takashiro "Fuu..fugh! Higuu!"

[MSG$02B1EA,101]
It's clear that Ms. Takashiro is enjoying it, maybe because she'd been violated for such a long time.

[MSG$02B254,62]
Each time I pull back, she tightens up, not wanting to let go.

[MSG$02B29F,61]
I felt the urge to come after thrusting into her for a while.

[MSG$02B2E9,61]
I start a final spurt of speed without holding anything back.

[MSG$02B333,10]
Banging...

[MSG$02B34A,79]
The sound of our bodies slapping against each other echoed throughout the room.

[MSG$02B39E,64]
It overlapped with the sound of our heavy, quickening breathing.

[MSG$02B3EB,20]
Minase "I'm coming!"

[MSG$02B50B,26]
Cock juice shooting out...

[MSG$02B532,50]
Then I came inside Ms. Takashiro with great force.

[MSG$02B571,57]
I shoot a lot of semen up inside her as my body twitches.

[MSG$02B5B7,16]
Takashiro "Unn!"

[MSG$02B5E1,82]
Ms. Takashiro takes in my juice.  I can tell she's feeling both pain and pleasure.

[MSG$02B640,23]
Minase "Hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$02B671,76]
After I release all my sperm, I calm down my breathing and pull my cock out.

[MSG$02B743,14]
Pulling out...

[MSG$02B75E,24]
White cum pouring out...

[MSG$02B783,76]
As I pull out, hot white liquid pours out, as if floodgates just broke open.

[MSG$02B7D4,77]
The combined liquid loads of Ms. Kitami and myself pour out onto the floor...

[MSG$02B82E,32]
Kitami "Well? Did you enjoy it?"

[MSG$02B868,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$02B891,87]
Ms. Takashiro is totally zoned out and exhausted, as if she can't hear anything at all.

[MSG$02B8F5,49]
Kitami "Now, let us all entertain Ms. Takashiro!"

[MSG$02B940,67]
Ms. Kitami motions to the group in the corner with their cocks out.

[MSG$02B990,72]
But Ms. Takashiro doesn't respond at all, and lets them do as they wish.

[MSG$02BA62,67]
The guys pounce on Ms. Takashiro, and smother her like wild beasts.

[MSG$02BAAA,86]
The ones waiting for their turn were pleasuring themselves with her hands and breasts.

[MSG$02BB0D,78]
Ms. Kitami removes the gag from Ms. Takashiro's mouth, and jams a cock inside.

[MSG$02BB60,76]
Some of the others started rubbing their cocks on her legs and hair as well.

[MSG$02BBB9,63]
Ms. Takashiro is using her entire body to satisfy these guys...

[MSG$02BBFD,110]
In a blink of an eye, the guys start releasing themselves, Ms. Takashiro is getting filthy inside and outside.

[MSG$02BCF5,62]
After a long while passes, the men leave her body lying there.

[MSG$02BD38,59]
Ms. Takashiro is trembling in the chair, totally out of it.

[MSG$02BD80,29]
Takashiro "U..uu..Gha..gha.."

[MSG$02BDB7,82]
Lots of cum had been forced down her throat, and now it was pouring out her mouth.

[MSG$02BE16,79]
Ms. Takashiro's body is sticky with about ten different shades of white liquid.

[MSG$02BE6A,49]
Steam is rising off the cum and she looks filthy.

[MSG$02BEA8,71]
The smell of sperm from her body is so strong it makes me wanna puke...

[MSG$02BEFC,39]
Kitami "You look very pretty. Ahahaha."

[MSG$02BF3D,49]
Takashiro "Keh...Why are you doing...this to me?"

[MSG$02BF88,75]
Ms. Takashiro is speaking with a weak voice. Ms. Kitami only ridiculed her.

[MSG$02BFE0,79]
Kitami "Because it's fun. It's fun watching people suffer over and over again."

[MSG$02C049,63]
Kitami "A face filled with pain, a face filled with pleasure...

[MSG$02C08D,39]
They all turn me on in different ways."

[MSG$02C0CE,27]
Takashiro "You're crazy..."

[MSG$02C103,63]
Kitami "That's right, I'm crazy. But the entire world is crazy.

[MSG$02C147,36]
People just don't want to admit it."

[MSG$02C185,118]
Kitami "Take a look at our world. Genocides, science out of control, corruption as a way of life. God has forsaken us.

[MSG$02C200,91]
Humanity ignores the Ten Commandments, and continues to commit mortal sin after mortal sin.

[MSG$02C260,63]
Ruled by a bunch of hypocrites, this world is filled with sin."

[MSG$02C2B9,75]
Kitami "And in a world like this, we're the only ones who fit in perfectly.

[MSG$02C309,33]
This world needs people like me."

[MSG$02C344,30]
Takashiro "You...who are you?"

[MSG$02C37C,51]
Kitami "I made a pact with the devil 12 years ago."

[MSG$02C3C9,27]
Takashiro "That's a lie..."

[MSG$02C3FE,94]
Kitami "No, it's true. It all happened 12 years ago...That tragic day is when it all started."

[MSG$02C476,94]
Takashiro "I know all about that incident. I knew all the members of that group...that coven."

[MSG$02C4EE,35]
Takashiro "But I don't know you..."

[MSG$02C52B,102]
Kitami "Of course not. I'm not related to your coven. I didn't even have any interest in Black Magic."

[MSG$02C5AB,21]
Takashiro "Then why?"

[MSG$02C5DA,64]
Kitami "Enough with the talking. You're gonna be one of us soon.

[MSG$02C61F,49]
Even if I told you, it wouldn't change anything."

[MSG$02C66B,53]
Kitami "I'll tell you about it when I feel like it...

[MSG$02C6A5,54]
That is, if you can maintain your sanity long enough."

[MSG$02C6F5,69]
Takashiro "Wait! Tell me just one thing. What are you planning to do?

[MSG$02C73F,61]
Are you trying to summon a demon like they did 12 years ago?"

[MSG$02C796,98]
Kitami "I told you before. I already made a pact with the devil...I don't need to summon a demon."

[MSG$02C812,61]
Takashiro "Pact... You mean you sold your soul to the devil?"

[MSG$02C869,60]
Kitami "That's right...And now, my pact is about to expire."

[MSG$02C8BF,73]
Takashiro "So that's why you did all this... It's an act of desperation?"

[MSG$02C922,58]
Kitami "No. I found a spell to free myself from the pact."

[MSG$02C976,34]
Takashiro "What? It's impossible!"

[MSG$02C9B2,75]
Kitami "You'll find out soon enough. Until then, try to keep yourself sane.

[MSG$02CA02,77]
If you're lucky, you'll be able to witness the event with your own two eyes."

[MSG$02CA69,38]
Takashiro "You're trying to trick me!"

[MSG$02CAA9,80]
Kitami "Actually, I think I said enough. Now, let's start again from the top..."

[MSG$02CB13,31]
Kitami "Get her off the chair."

[MSG$02CB4C,37]
Takashiro "Aren't you satisfied yet?"

[MSG$02CC08,42]
They release Ms. Takashiro from the chair.

[MSG$02CC37,118]
Her hands and feet are numb and she doesn't struggle, maybe because she had been tied up for so long in that position.

[MSG$02CD3F,78]
After she's rolled onto the floor, she's tied up again so that she can't move.

[MSG$02CD92,85]
Her mouth is gagged with a tube, and it's secured tightly so that she can't close it.

[MSG$02CDF4,22]
Takashiro "Aaah! Agh!"

[MSG$02CE24,73]
Ms. Takashiro can't talk, and all she could do was make pitiful noises. *

[MSG$02CE78,76]
Kitami "I'm going to give you the water torture. You know what it is, right?

[MSG$02CEC9,77]
During the middle ages, they used this form of torture on suspected witches."

[MSG$02CF30,96]
Kitami "You're gonna be forced to drink lots of water, until you prostrate yourself before me...

[MSG$02CF95,35]
I wonder how much you can drink..."

[MSG$02CFD2,14]
Takashiro "!?"

[MSG$02CFFA,24]
Kitami "Cover her nose."

[MSG$02D02C,72]
I stick a rubber stopper up into her nose to prevent her from breathing.

[MSG$02D079,43]
Now she can only breathe through her mouth.

[MSG$02D0B1,33]
Kitami "Now I'll let you drink...

[MSG$02D0D7,82]
If you don't drink it down as fast as you can, you'll suffocate. Heh, heh, heh..."

[MSG$02D1BC,48]
Ms. Kitami connects a rubber hose to the faucet,

[MSG$02D1F1,72]
and sticks the other end into Ms. Takashiro's mouth and down her throat.

[MSG$02D23E,33]
She slowly turns on the faucet...

[MSG$02D26C,19]
Water shoots out...

[MSG$02D305,54]
The sound of water running through the hose continues,

[MSG$02D340,40]
lots of water is swelling down the hose.

[MSG$02D375,19]
Water gushes out...

[MSG$02D395,27]
Takashiro "Agh! Ung..ungh!"

[MSG$02D3CA,45]
Water is running down the sides of her mouth.

[MSG$02D3FC,77]
At the same her throat starts contracting as she swallows as much as she can.

[MSG$02D456,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02D474,70]
Ms. Kitami turns the faucet to adjust the amount of water pouring out.

[MSG$02D4BF,74]
She adjusts it to a point where very little water comes out of the faucet.

[MSG$02D516,75]
With this method, Ms. Takashiro can only breathe when she drinks the water.

[MSG$02D566,60]
Ms. Takashiro has to keep on drinking in order to breathe...

[MSG$02D5AF,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02D5CD,16]
Takashiro "Pha!"

[MSG$02D5F7,59]
Ms. Takashiro gulps down the water and takes a deep breath.

[MSG$02D637,64]
But the water accumulates and prevents her from breathing again.

[MSG$02D684,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02D6A2,35]
Ms. Takashiro continues to drink...

[MSG$02D6D2,42]
After a while, her face starts to contort.

[MSG$02D709,41]
Her stomach must be full of water by now.

[MSG$02D737,57]
But she has no choice but to drink, or she can't breathe.

[MSG$02D77D,100]
Soon, she starts drinking slower and slower, and the time she has to hold her breath becomes longer.

[MSG$02D7EE,63]
She continues to hold her breath until she can't take any more,

[MSG$02D832,51]
and then gulps down more water in order to breathe.

[MSG$02D872,62]
Her stomach is swelling from all the water she's sucking down.

[MSG$02D8B5,42]
She must've drank several liters by now...

[MSG$02D8EC,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02D90A,75]
Ms. Takashiro's eyes roll back a bit, and I can see the whites of her eyes.

[MSG$02D95A,85]
Bubbles are beginning to form at the corners of her mouth due to the amount of water.

[MSG$02D9B4,99]
But she still can hardly keep up with the speed of water coming out, and she is about to suffocate.

[MSG$02DA24,29]
Kitami "Turn off the faucet."

[MSG$02DA5B,33]
The faucet is turned off quickly.

[MSG$02DA89,26]
Takashiro "Kha! Gha! Gah!"

[MSG$02DABD,81]
Then Ms. Takashiro coughs up some water and begins devouring the air frantically.

[MSG$02DB1B,68]
Kitami "You only drank about 4 liters. You can do better than that."

[MSG$02DB7A,48]
Kitami "All right, I'll let you rest for a bit."

[MSG$02DBC4,67]
Ms. Kitami signals me to remove the gag from Ms. Takashiro's mouth.

[MSG$02DC8D,16]
Takashiro "Gfu!"

[MSG$02DCB7,22]
Takashiro "No more..."

[MSG$02DCE7,68]
Kitami "No...We'll keep on doing this until you surrender yourself."

[MSG$02DD45,19]
Takashiro "What..."

[MSG$02DD72,79]
Takashiro "I can't drink anymore...If I drink more, my stomach will explode..."

[MSG$02DDDB,81]
Kitami "Don't worry. The human body is quite elastic. You can drink plenty more."

[MSG$02DE46,23]
Takashiro "I'll die..."

[MSG$02DE77,37]
Kitami "Now, let's get back to work."

[MSG$02DEB6,51]
I stick the hose down Ms. Takashiro's throat again.

[MSG$02DF6F,33]
Takashiro "Stop it Minase...ngh!"

[MSG$02DFAA,55]
The hose is inserted and the faucet is turned on again.

[MSG$02DFEE,27]
Takashiro "Ung..ung..ungh!"

[MSG$02E023,55]
Kitami "See, I knew you could drink more...heh, heh..."

[MSG$02E074,59]
Kitami "You're gonna drink more. At least 4 more liters..."

[MSG$02E0C9,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02E0E7,80]
Ms. Takashiro's Adam's apple moves up and down, and starts swallowing the water.

[MSG$02E144,43]
Soon, her face becomes contorted with pain.

[MSG$02E174,99]
There's a limit how much water a human being can take in at once. I'm pretty sure she's reached it.

[MSG$02E1E4,74]
Kitami "I'll go get ready for the next act, so I'm leaving you in charge."

[MSG$02E248,39]
Ms. Kitami put her hand on my shoulder.

[MSG$02E27C,14]
Minase "Sure."

[MSG$02E2A4,79]
After Ms. Kitami leaves, I keep watching Ms. Takashiro struggle with the water.

[MSG$02E300,17]
Drinking water...

[MSG$02E31E,45]
Ms. Takashiro keeps drinking with teary eyes.

[MSG$02E350,81]
I don't know how many liters she drank, but her stomach was surprisingly swollen.

[MSG$02E3AE,71]
Minase "I have nothing against you personally, but you should give up."

[MSG$02E40F,23]
Takashiro "Ung..ung..."

[MSG$02E440,60]
Then she stops drinking, and is about to lose consciousness.

[MSG$02E4A9,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$02E4C5,83]
Ms. Takashiro stops drinking completely, and water starts to pour from her mouth...

[MSG$02E51D,50]
She stops breathing, and about 20 seconds pass by.

[MSG$02E55C,47]
Her eyes turn white and her body is convulsing.

[MSG$02E590,42]
If I leave her like this, she's gonna die.

[MSG$02E5C7,32]
Saeki "She's gonna die, Minase."

[MSG$02E601,62]
Saeki is watching quietly from the corner.  She steps forward.

[MSG$02E65A,54]
I quickly remove the hose from her mouth and free her.

[MSG$02E716,18]
Takashiro "Gfu..."

[MSG$02E742,28]
Takashiro "Gebha..gha! Geh!"

[MSG$02E778,77]
Ms. Takashiro takes a deep breath, vomits up water from her mouth and coughs.

[MSG$02E7D2,32]
Takashiro "Hah...hah...ha.hhh.."

[MSG$02E80C,31]
Takashiro "Minase...help me..."

[MSG$02E845,31]
Minase "It's no use asking me."

[MSG$02E87E,29]
Minase "Now, let's continue."

[MSG$02E8B5,63]
Takashiro "Are you trying to kill me? I can't drink anymore..."

[MSG$02E90E,58]
Minase "If you decide to join us, then you will be saved."

[MSG$02E962,29]
Takashiro "I can't do that...

[MSG$02E984,78]
Besides, that woman is planning to make me suffer until I'm torn to pieces..."

[MSG$02E9EC,35]
Minase "That's good enough for me."

[MSG$02EA29,18]
Takashiro "What!?"

[MSG$02EACF,79]
I put the hose back into Ms. Takashiro's mouth, and start pouring more water...

[MSG$02EB2B,45]
Ms. Takashiro drinks the water unwillingly...

[MSG$02EB5D,100]
Her stomach was swelling up like crazy, and it would probably burst if you stabbed it with a needle.

[MSG$02EBCE,56]
Kitami "Your stomach is pretty big. You're like a frog."

[MSG$02EC21,47]
Ms. Kitami returns, chuckling at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02EC5D,74]
Kitami "She's probably at her limit. I don't think she can drink anymore."

[MSG$02ECC1,38]
Kitami "Okay, you can stop the water."

[MSG$02ED01,60]
The faucet is turned off, and the water stops pouring out...

[MSG$02ED4A,51]
I remove the stopper blocking Ms. Takashiro's nose.

[MSG$02EE07,15]
Takashiro "Uh!"

[MSG$02EE30,16]
Takashiro "Gha!"

[MSG$02EE5A,86]
Water shoots out of Ms. Takashiro's mouth and nose, and keeps pouring and pouring out.

[MSG$02EEBD,21]
Takashiro "Gha! Keh!"

[MSG$02EEEC,72]
She calms down but now Ms. Takashiro is out of it and can't move at all.

[MSG$02EF39,75]
Well, it's probably difficult for her to get up with her stomach like that.

[MSG$02EF91,62]
Kitami "Well, what do you think after drinking all that water?

[MSG$02EFD4,61]
You just might end up in the Guinness Book of World Records."

[MSG$02F02B,23]
Takashiro "Bathroom..."

[MSG$02F05C,45]
Ms. Takashiro is speaking softly and shaking.

[MSG$02F096,96]
Kitami "Bathroom? I see, you want to pee. You drank that much, so I guess your bladder is full."

[MSG$02F110,75]
Kitami "All right, since you're already wet, go ahead and pee right there."

[MSG$02F175,17]
Takashiro "No..."

[MSG$02F1A0,51]
Kitami "You're so spoiled! Fine, use this instead."

[MSG$02F266,49]
Then Ms. Kitami places a wash basin on the floor.

[MSG$02F2A4,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$02F2CF,98]
Kitami "With that stomach of yours, you probably won't make it to the bathroom on your own. Here."

[MSG$02F34B,50]
Takashiro "No...Ah..aah! I can't hold it anymore!"

[MSG$02F397,49]
Kitami "Minase, push on Ms. Takashiro's stomach."

[MSG$02F3E2,23]
Takashiro "No! No, no!"

[MSG$02F413,67]
I place my hand on Ms. Takashiro's lower abdomen, and push lightly.

[MSG$02F463,18]
Takashiro "Unaaa!"

[MSG$02F508,12]
Urinating...

[MSG$02F521,63]
A clear yellow liquid is shooting out of her crotch with force.

[MSG$02F565,64]
It's so forceful, the washbasin is moving away little by little.

[MSG$02F5B2,48]
Takashiro "Aa...doesn't stop...it won't stop..."

[MSG$02F5FC,85]
She urinates for a long time, splashing all over the floor and filling the washbasin.

[MSG$02F6D7,12]
Urinating...

[MSG$02F6F0,44]
Her peeing slows, but it still trickles out.

[MSG$02F721,60]
It's like a faucet that hasn't been completely turned off...

[MSG$02F76A,74]
Kitami "You really wet yourself. The washbasin is full of your dirty pee."

[MSG$02F7CE,20]
Takashiro "U..uu..."

[MSG$02F7FC,71]
Kitami "But your stomach is still full. It looks like you're pregnant."

[MSG$02F85D,71]
Kitami "Now, I'll let you have this. It'll drive you out of your mind."

[MSG$02F8BE,45]
Ms. Kitami takes the washbasin full of urine.

[MSG$02F8F8,27]
Takashiro "You can't be..."

[MSG$02F92D,52]
Kitami "Minase, hand me that big hypodermic needle."

[MSG$02F97C,40]
I grabbed the needle like I was told to.

[MSG$02F9A9,64]
But it was actually a plunger for giving an enema, not a needle.

[MSG$02F9F6,64]
Takashiro "Please don't! I can't take anything in my stomach..."

[MSG$02FA50,109]
Kitami "We won't know unless we try. You can blow it out your ass. It's like killing 2 birds with one stone."

[MSG$02FAD7,31]
Takashiro "No...please stop..."

[MSG$02FB10,97]
Ms. Takashiro starts crying with a desperate look on her face as I approach her with the plunger.

[MSG$02FB7E,61]
Kitami "You put it inside her. Let's just start with 3000cc."

[MSG$02FBD5,35]
Takashiro "I can't take that much!"

[MSG$02FC12,57]
Kitami "Don't worry, you'll be releasing it soon enough."

[MSG$02FCE2,42]
As they talk, I suck up the steaming urine

[MSG$02FD11,38]
from the washbasin with the plunger...

[MSG$02FD44,89]
The cylinder is full, so I cover the opening with my finger and approached Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$02FDAA,32]
Takashiro "No, stop it, Minase!"

[MSG$02FDE4,38]
Kitami "Now, get ready for insertion."

[MSG$02FEA0,53]
Ms. Kitami forces Ms. Takashiro to stick out her ass.

[MSG$02FEE2,87]
Ms. Takashiro sticks out her ass in front of me while enduring the pain in her stomach.

[MSG$02FF3E,61]
Her swollen stomach looks even bigger hanging down like that.

[MSG$02FF88,18]
Kitami "Go ahead."

[MSG$03002D,57]
I insert the tip of the plunger into Ms. Takashiro's ass.

[MSG$030073,16]
Takashiro "Hee!"

[MSG$03009D,63]
I take the plunger and push it up into her ass with a thrust...

[MSG$030162,37]
Takashiro "No! It's entering my ass!"

[MSG$0301A1,34]
Ms. Takashiro's ass was trembling.

[MSG$0301C8,102]
The liquid went smoothly inside her, maybe because she couldn't put any pressure on her lower stomach.

[MSG$03023B,66]
I empty all 500cc inside her, and pull the plunger out of her ass.

[MSG$030303,32]
Takashiro "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$03033D,72]
I continue to suck up urine from the washbasin for the second insertion.

[MSG$03038A,47]
Then I stick the plunger up her ass once again.

[MSG$03043F,18]
Takashiro "Ugh..."

[MSG$03046B,91]
I press the back of the plunger and release Ms. Takashiro's hot urine back up into her ass.

[MSG$03054C,17]
Takashiro "Kuuu!"

[MSG$030577,76]
Ms. Takashiro's face is red, she's enduring the humiliation as best she can.

[MSG$0305D0,73]
Kitami "To let one of your students give you an enema...you're pathetic."

[MSG$030633,49]
Ms. Kitami looks over Ms. Takashiro and chuckles.

[MSG$030671,23]
Takashiro "Higu..uu..."

[MSG$03071B,79]
I finish releasing the second load, and suck up another one from the washbasin.

[MSG$030777,45]
Takashiro "No more..I can't take any more..."

[MSG$0307BE,99]
Kitami "What are you talking about? You've only had two so far. We need to squirt four more inside,

[MSG$030826,20]
so just be patient."

[MSG$030854,63]
I prepare the third load and shove it into Ms. Takashiro's ass.

[MSG$030919,18]
Takashiro "Ughhh!"

[MSG$030945,76]
Every time I finish injecting a load, Ms. Takashiro's stomach swells bigger.

[MSG$030996,61]
I'm sure she's got plenty of liquid inside her body by now...

[MSG$0309E0,56]
I prepare the fourth load and inject it up into her ass.

[MSG$030A9E,16]
Takashiro "Kha!"

[MSG$030AC8,65]
It gets harder to force the contents of the plunger into her ass.

[MSG$030B0E,72]
If I relax my hand, the urine comes flowing backwards into the cylinder.

[MSG$030B5B,28]
I guess she's almost full...

[MSG$030B84,80]
I finish releasing the fourth load, and prepare a fifth load from the washbasin.

[MSG$030BE1,16]
Sucking up urine

[MSG$030BFE,63]
After I fill up the fifth load, the washbasin is already empty.

[MSG$030C4A,31]
Minase "The washbasin's empty."

[MSG$030C83,63]
Kitami "All right, I'll get something else we can use instead."

[MSG$030CDC,64]
Ms. Kitami takes a cup and walks over to the corner of the room.

[MSG$030D29,75]
I go on and push the plunger holding the fifth load up Ms. Takashiro's ass.

[MSG$030DFA,42]
Takashiro "No more..I can't take anymore!"

[MSG$030E3E,54]
Her face is contorted with pain.  She begs me to stop.

[MSG$030E81,27]
Minase "We're almost done."

[MSG$030EB6,41]
Then I release the contents into her ass.

[MSG$030F65,18]
Takashiro "Higuu!"

[MSG$030F91,29]
As I release it into her ass,

[MSG$030FB3,46]
I can only get the plunger depressed part way.

[MSG$030FEE,72]
When I release my hand, the liquid shoots backwards into the cylinder...

[MSG$031043,23]
Minase "Hang in there."

[MSG$031074,43]
Takashiro "I can't. I can't take any more."

[MSG$0310B9,59]
Minase "No. I'll keep going until everything's inside you."

[MSG$03110E,60]
Then I applied more force and got all the pee up in her ass.

[MSG$031157,26]
Takashiro "Kuuuu..Aaah..."

[MSG$03118B,66]
I emptied the contents from the plunger after a bit of a struggle.

[MSG$0311D2,74]
I make sure everything is in there, and pull out the plunger from her ass.

[MSG$0312A2,42]
Kitami "Here, use this to finish her off."

[MSG$0312E6,51]
Ms. Kitami returns and places a cup in front of me.

[MSG$031326,58]
There is a large amount of creamy white liquid in the cup.

[MSG$031365,39]
I can tell that it is cum by the smell.

[MSG$031399,105]
I look in the corner of the room, and there are several exhausted male students resting against the wall.

[MSG$031407,49]
I bet this cup full of sperm was taken from them.

[MSG$031445,79]
I place the tip of the plunger into the liquid, and slowly start sucking it in.

[MSG$0314A1,95]
After sucking up everything in the cup, the white liquid only fills up about half the cylinder.

[MSG$03150D,44]
Kitami "It's still not enough...I got it..."

[MSG$031553,73]
Then Ms. Kitami tells me to stick the plunger into Ms. Takashiro's pussy.

[MSG$031622,7]
Stab...

[MSG$031636,18]
Takashiro "Ugh..."

[MSG$031662,89]
I stick the plunger into her pussy, and start sucking up the juice that's filling her up.

[MSG$0316C8,57]
Kitami "I knew there was plenty of juice stored there..."

[MSG$031794,19]
Sucking up juice...

[MSG$0317B4,18]
Takashiro "Uuu..."

[MSG$0317E0,94]
The cum filling her vagina is sucked up into the plunger, and the cylinder becomes very white.

[MSG$03184B,62]
I feel nauseous from seeing all this thick cum in front of me.

[MSG$03188E,55]
The white liquid is lying stagnant inside the cylinder.

[MSG$0318D2,56]
Then I approach Ms. Takashiro's ass with the sixth load.

[MSG$031990,20]
Minase "Last one..."

[MSG$0319BE,40]
I slowly push the contents into her ass.

[MSG$0319EB,60]
The white cream enters Ms. Takashiro's body through her ass.

[MSG$031AAD,17]
Takashiro "Unnn!"

[MSG$031B51,26]
Pulling the plunger out...

[MSG$031B78,70]
I finish emptying the contents, and pull the plunger out of her ass...

[MSG$031BC3,94]
The viscous liquid left a long white thread trailing from her ass to the tip of the plunger.

[MSG$031C2E,28]
Kitami "It all went inside."

[MSG$031C64,38]
Takashiro "I can't take it anymore..."

[MSG$031CA4,58]
Kitami "You did great. It's amazing you took all that in."

[MSG$031CF8,40]
Takashiro "A..aah..my stomach..hurts..."

[MSG$031D3A,32]
Kitami "Well you did take a lot.

[MSG$031D5F,57]
You're tough, you might be able to hold it for 5 minutes.

[MSG$031D9D,62]
Most people wouldn't be able to do it for more than a minute."

[MSG$031DF5,38]
Takashiro "Let me go to the bathroom!"

[MSG$031E35,41]
Kitami "I don't know...What should I do?"

[MSG$031E78,39]
Takashiro "I can't hold it any longer!"

[MSG$031EB9,21]
Her stomach churns...

[MSG$031EDB,61]
You can clearly hear the sounds from Ms. Takashiro's stomach.

[MSG$031F1D,46]
I'm sure she's feeling serious pain right now.

[MSG$031F58,31]
Takashiro "Hee! Ugh! Bathroom!"

[MSG$031F91,62]
Ms. Takashiro's body is covered in greasy sweat and twitching.

[MSG$031FD4,67]
Her face is contorted with pain and the urge to go to the bathroom.

[MSG$032024,75]
Kitami "Can't you hold it in a bit longer for me? Cork up her ass, Minase."

[MSG$032089,79]
I stroke my cock to make it erect, and place it up against Ms. Takashiro's ass.

[MSG$0320E5,74]
Takashiro "No! If you stick that thing inside, everything will shoot out!"

[MSG$032149,64]
Kitami "Even if you want to shoot it out, you won't be able to."

[MSG$0321A4,69]
I thrust my hips forward and stick the tip of my cock inside her ass.

[MSG$0321EE,33]
My cock enters her twitching ass.

[MSG$032295,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$0322AE,16]
Takashiro "Hee!"

[MSG$0322D8,58]
Maybe it's because there's so much pressure on her rectum,

[MSG$032317,48]
but I feel like my cock is being held in a vise.

[MSG$032354,47]
Takashiro "No! Pull it out! I'm gonna explode!"

[MSG$03239D,47]
Kitami "I want you to start thrusting, Minase."

[MSG$0323E6,39]
I started moving back and forth slowly.

[MSG$03241A,25]
Takashiro "Kah! Hee! No!"

[MSG$03244D,51]
I move inside her tight rectum with strong thrusts.

[MSG$03248D,82]
With her rectum tightening up on me, I feel pleasure, but it was starting to hurt.

[MSG$0324E4,76]
Even a slow thrust feels fantastic, but I can't really move around freely...

[MSG$03253D,44]
Takashiro "Shoot out! It's gonna shoot out!"

[MSG$032583,48]
Ms. Takashiro relaxes the muscles in her rectum.

[MSG$0325C0,69]
I feel a great pressure against my cock, something trying to get out.

[MSG$03260A,41]
I hold it inside by thrusting against it.

[MSG$032640,39]
Takashiro "It hurts! My stomach hurts!"

[MSG$032681,45]
Kitami "You can't shoot anything out, right?"

[MSG$0326C8,46]
Takashiro "Help! My stomach is gonna explode!"

[MSG$032710,41]
Kitami "Will you join us if we help you?"

[MSG$032753,15]
Takashiro "No!"

[MSG$03277C,33]
Kitami "Then deal with the pain."

[MSG$0327B7,26]
Takashiro "Die..I'll die!"

[MSG$0327EB,18]
Kitami "Go ahead."

[MSG$032817,58]
Takashiro "I'll join you. I'll join you, so just help me!"

[MSG$03286B,32]
Kitami "Heh, heh..are you sure?"

[MSG$0328A5,59]
Takashiro "Yes! I don't care what happens, just let me go!"

[MSG$0328FA,43]
Kitami "Fine..I guess I'll help you, then."

[MSG$03293F,66]
Kitami "But it doesn't look like you can make it to the bathroom."

[MSG$03299B,56]
Takashiro "I don't care! Here..let me do it right here!"

[MSG$0329ED,49]
Kitami "All right..You can pull out now, Minase."

[MSG$032AB1,14]
Pulling out...

[MSG$032ACC,42]
I pull my cock out of Ms. Takashiro's ass.

[MSG$032AFB,60]
Even after I pull out, her ass is still twitching violently.

[MSG$032B44,17]
Takashiro "Fugh!"

[MSG$032BF8,13]
Shooting out!

[MSG$032C12,18]
Takashiro "Hauuu!"

[MSG$032C3E,90]
Ms. Takashiro released a blast of water and cum out her ass and climaxed at the same time.

[MSG$032C9D,75]
She was having a screaming orgasm as she flopped and twitched on the floor.

[MSG$032CF5,15]
Shooting out...

[MSG$032D11,62]
Kitami "Ahahahaha. You look pathetic. Aren't you embarrassed?"

[MSG$032D69,113]
Liquid is pouring out of Ms. Takashiro's ass like a water fountain.  It keeps on coming out with no end in sight.

[MSG$032DE7,20]
Takashiro "Uu! Hau!"

[MSG$032E15,17]
Takashiro "Aaah!"

[MSG$032EBD,22]
Liquid shooting out...

[MSG$032EE0,44]
Then she started urinating at the same time.

[MSG$032F11,101]
Even though the large intestine can absorb lots of liquid, she still shoots out pee like a waterfall.

[MSG$032F83,21]
Kitami "How awful..."

[MSG$032FB2,46]
Takashiro "Aaah..won't stop..it won't stop..."

[MSG$032FFA,63]
I watch closely as liquid comes flying out from both her holes.

[MSG$03303E,49]
I can see her stomach slowly returning to normal.

[MSG$03307C,69]
After going through all this, I'm sure Ms. Takashiro won't defy us...

[MSG$0330CE,105]
Ms. Takashiro keeps shooting out liquids for a long time, and everyone smiles gleefully as she continues.

[MSG$033144,72]
Eventually she stops, and her body goes limp as she collapses in a daze.

[MSG$033199,41]
I guess she exhausted herself completely.

[MSG$0331C7,70]
She certainly looks miserable.  She can see what came out of her body.

[MSG$033293,32]
Takashiro "Hah...hah...hahhh..."

[MSG$0332CD,35]
Kitami "I guess it's finally over."

[MSG$03330A,62]
Kitami "Now, for the finishing touch. Go get me that, Minase."

[MSG$033362,27]
I grab what she pointed to.

[MSG$033382,44]
It is an iron rod heated on a cooking stove.

[MSG$0333BB,64]
At the tip is a metallic mold in the shape of a circular emblem.

[MSG$033408,72]
The branding iron is burning red hot from the fire in the cooking stove.

[MSG$033455,38]
It has the numbers 666 carved into it.

[MSG$033488,42]
I grab the rod and approach Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$0334BF,25]
Takashiro "What is that?"

[MSG$0334F2,72]
Kitami "You're going to join us, right? That's why we have to brand you.

[MSG$03353F,30]
This is so you won't defy us."

[MSG$033578,77]
Kitami "666. The number that represents the devil in the Book of Revelations.

[MSG$0335CA,72]
With this emblem, you'll give up God and become a servant of the devil."

[MSG$03362C,22]
Takashiro "Stop it..."

[MSG$03365C,61]
Ms. Takashiro looks at the red-hot emblem and shakes in fear.

[MSG$0336A6,94]
Kitami "Now, you'll have the mark of a witch on your body, and you can never get rid of it..."

[MSG$03379B,100]
Ms. Kitami makes eye contact with me, and I slowly approach Ms. Takashiro with the red-hot emblem...

[MSG$03380C,24]
Takashiro "No! Stop it!"

[MSG$03383E,69]
I ignore Ms. Takashiro, and press the branding iron against her skin.

[MSG$03390E,10]
Burning...

[MSG$033925,18]
Takashiro "Gyaaa!"

[MSG$033951,82]
A bit of smoke puffs out, and the terrible smell of flesh burning reaches my nose.

[MSG$033A2E,12]
Urinating...

[MSG$033A47,62]
Then Ms. Takashiro pees herself again and loses consciousness.

[MSG$033A8A,72]
It must've been painful, since she still has a look of fear on her face.

[MSG$033ADF,72]
After pressing the brand into her skin for a minute, I remove it slowly.

[MSG$033BB2,14]
I take a look.

[MSG$033BC5,51]
The emblem is reversed, and she's badly burned red.

[MSG$033C05,29]
Kitami "It came out nicely...

[MSG$033C27,102]
If you get pregnant, you probably won't be able to go to the hospital with that mark on you. Ahahaha!"

[MSG$033CA7,88]
Ms. Kitami examines the emblem on Ms. Takashiro's body.  She starts to chuckle with joy.

[MSG$033D21,47]
Kitami "Now, I'm gonna give her an anesthetic."

[MSG$033DE7,37]
She stabs Ms. Takashiro with a needle

[MSG$033E11,26]
containing a green liquid.

[MSG$033E38,92]
Kitami "Your pain will become pleasure. And you'll never want to leave us. Heh, heh, heh..."

[MSG$033EAE,72]
We continue, taking turns violating Ms. Takashiro until late at night...

[MSG$033F03,80]
Drugs and pleasure intoxicate us, as we continue having sex in a massive orgy...

[MSG$033F58,31]
Now, we have nothing to fear...

[MSG$033FFF,24]

[MSG$034076,18]
April 27 - Morning

[MSG$034090,18]
Voice "Wake up..."

[MSG$0340BC,23]
Voice "Hey, wake up..."

[MSG$0340ED,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$034194,16]
Minase "Uuun..."

[MSG$0341BE,60]
Voice "Minase, you're gonna be late if you don't wake up..."

[MSG$034214,9]
Shakes...

[MSG$03422A,15]
Shakes again...

[MSG$034246,37]
Minase "All right, I'm getting up..."

[MSG$034285,91]
I stop trying to sleep through her shaking, and I force myself to wake up and open my eyes.

[MSG$0342ED,23]
Imari "Good morning..."

[MSG$03431E,31]
Minase "Oh, it's you, Imari..."

[MSG$034357,46]
Imari is standing in my room just like always.

[MSG$03438A,57]
But her expression and attitude is different from before.

[MSG$0343D0,90]
Usually, she comes and rips off my blanket to wake me up, but today she is rather subdued.

[MSG$034437,58]
I rub my sleepy eyes and remember what happened yesterday.

[MSG$034476,64]
Right, I was at the apartment until late at night getting off...

[MSG$0344C3,43]
I don't remember how and when I got home...

[MSG$03459A,36]
Imari "It's time to go to school..."

[MSG$0345D8,62]
The humble Imari is speaking quietly and with some hesitation.

[MSG$034623,32]
Minase "It's that time already?"

[MSG$03465D,97]
I don't feel like I slept much...I guess it's because I was at the apartment until late at night.

[MSG$0346CB,107]
I don't feel tired when I'm up on the drugs, but when the effects wear off, that's when it really hits you.

[MSG$03473B,55]
Even now, my head doesn't feel so good from last night.

[MSG$03477F,51]
Imari's sexy image from last night comes to mind...

[MSG$0347BF,69]
Imari acting so different embarrassing herself over and over again...

[MSG$034809,69]
After seeing her like that, I could never look at her the same again.

[MSG$034853,42]
We can never go back to the way we were...

[MSG$03488A,55]
I get up slowly from bed and start changing my clothes.

[MSG$0348CE,27]
Minase "Where's my sister?"

[MSG$034903,38]
Imari "Yukiko went out a while ago..."

[MSG$034943,15]
Minase "I see."

[MSG$0349E8,18]
Vibrating sound...

[MSG$034A07,45]
Then I hear a slight but harsh grating noise.

[MSG$034A41,32]
It's coming from Imari's body...

[MSG$034A6E,27]
Minase "What's that noise?"

[MSG$034AA3,13]
Imari "What?"

[MSG$034ACA,44]
Minase "I hear something...From your pussy."

[MSG$034B10,25]
I point at Imari's skirt.

[MSG$034B36,50]
Imari looks down at her skirt and begins to panic.

[MSG$034B6D,50]
I can see Imari clench her legs closed real tight.

[MSG$034BAC,17]
Imari "That's..."

[MSG$034BD7,64]
Imari is trying hard to come up with a lie, but she's bad at it.

[MSG$034C1C,22]
I decide to tease her.

[MSG$034C5F,28]
Minase "Pull up your skirt."

[MSG$034C95,13]
Imari "What?"

[MSG$034CBC,45]
Imari's body trembles after hearing my words.

[MSG$034CF6,56]
Minase "There's nothing to be embarrassed about, right?"

[MSG$034D48,14]
Imari "But..."

[MSG$034D7B,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$034D93,33]
Imari is silent and can't answer.

[MSG$034DC1,28]
Minase "What is that sound?"

[MSG$034DF7,80]
I tease her a little more. If she puts off telling me, she'll be late for class.

[MSG$034E54,25]
Imari "I can't say it..."

[MSG$034E87,50]
Minase "No. I won't let you go until you tell me."

[MSG$034ED3,22]
Imari "No, I can't..."

[MSG$034F03,41]
Minase "Then let me find out what it is."

[MSG$034F46,37]
Imari "No! All right..I'll tell you."

[MSG$034F85,22]
Minase "Then tell me."

[MSG$034FB5,15]
Imari "Well..."

[MSG$034FDE,47]
Imari is confused again and starts to hesitate.

[MSG$03501A,20]
Imari "Well it's..."

[MSG$035048,17]
Minase "Tell me."

[MSG$035073,17]
Imari "Va, va..."

[MSG$03509E,12]
Minase "Va?"

[MSG$0350C4,55]
Imari "Va... vibrator!  It's the sound of my vibrator!"

[MSG$035115,67]
Imari bunches up her shoulder as she's forced to embarrass herself.

[MSG$035165,38]
Minase "Vibrator, huh? Let me see it."

[MSG$0351A5,14]
Imari "What!?"

[MSG$0351CD,99]
Minase "There's no reason to be embarrassed now. Think about the things you were doing last night."

[MSG$03524A,19]
Imari "That was..."

[MSG$035277,82]
Imari's face turns red up to her ears in embarrassment, and she starts to tremble.

[MSG$0352D6,41]
Minase "You don't want to show it to me?"

[MSG$035319,61]
She seems to be troubled for a moment, but then she gives in.

[MSG$035363,20]
Imari "All right..."

[MSG$03540A,51]
Imari slowly lifts up her skirt with shaking hands.

[MSG$035442,23]
I watch her silently...

[MSG$035466,18]
Vibrating sound...

[MSG$035485,56]
Her chastity belt can be seen after she lifts her skirt,

[MSG$0354C2,40]
and I can hear the noise getting louder.

[MSG$0354F7,55]
A thin cord is coming from the same place the sound is.

[MSG$035533,96]
The cord is dangling from her asshole, and it is attached to a controller tucked into her socks.

[MSG$0355A0,100]
Her vagina is covered by the chastity belt, but her asshole is being stimulated with the vibrator...

[MSG$035611,63]
Minase "What is that? Are you gonna wear that thing to school?"

[MSG$03566A,36]
Imari "But Ms. Kitami told me to..."

[MSG$0356A8,59]
Minase "How can you stay calm with that thing up your ass?"

[MSG$0356FD,18]
Imari "I'm not..."

[MSG$035729,65]
Liquid is pouring out from between her ass and the chastity belt.

[MSG$03576F,56]
I'm a bit shocked to see Imari the way she is right now.

[MSG$0357B4,43]
I'm sure the drugs are still effecting her,

[MSG$0357E4,81]
but I never thought that the feisty Imari would end up becoming a slut like this.

[MSG$035842,74]
Minase "Whatever. I'll give you a reward since you did just what I asked."

[MSG$0358A7,36]
Minase "You want some drugs, right?"

[MSG$0358E5,22]
Imari "Give it to me."

[MSG$035915,36]
Imari looks at me and pleads for it.

[MSG$035946,84]
Imari got hooked on the aphrodisiac last night, and she has started to beg for more.

[MSG$0359A7,72]
I take out the drugs that I got from Ms. Kitami, and give some to Imari.

[MSG$0359F4,87]
Since we're going to school, I take a tiny amount and dilute it with Ringer's Solution.

[MSG$035A58,84]
I don't want her acting like Ito during class. Well, it would be interesting to see,

[MSG$035AB1,47]
but I think that's a bit too harsh for Imari...

[MSG$035AED,89]
Anyway Ms. Kitami put restrictions on the amount and number of times I can use the drugs.

[MSG$035B4B,49]
Imari is an important person, I can't damage her.

[MSG$035B89,14]
Imari "Kuh..."

[MSG$035BB1,77]
Imari sticks the needle I gave her into her thigh, and slowly pushes it in...

[MSG$035C0B,15]
Imari "Haaa..."

[MSG$035C34,109]
After she shoots up with the needle, she's intoxicated with pleasure.  She has a rapt expression on her face.

[MSG$035CA6,111]
Even though it's a small amount, it's enough for her. Soon, her body gets hot and she starts breathing heavily.

[MSG$035DC1,53]
Minase "Hey, let's go. We're going to school, right?"

[MSG$035E10,15]
Imari "Yeah..."

[MSG$035E39,64]
I drag the confused Imari out of the house and leave for school.

[MSG$035E86,26]
April 27 - Going to school

[MSG$035F4E,58]
I walk along the same path to school with Imari as always.

[MSG$035F95,83]
Imari is wobbling and swaying because of the drug.  She can't keep up with my pace.

[MSG$035FED,68]
Walking along with Imari is going to make for a long walk to school.

[MSG$03603E,29]
Imari "Walk a little slower."

[MSG$036075,94]
Minase "I can't walk any slower than this. If you don't hurry up, I'm gonna leave you behind."

[MSG$0360ED,100]
Because of the vibrator in her ass, she has her knees together and looks very uncomfortable walking.

[MSG$036156,53]
Clear liquid is running from between her closed legs.

[MSG$036198,18]
Imari "All right."

[MSG$0361C4,42]
Imari tries very hard to catch up with me.

[MSG$0361F3,44]
Her legs are shaking as she moves forward...

[MSG$03622C,31]
April 27 - Front gate of school

[MSG$03633E,76]
As we get to the front gate, I see Inoue and several others standing around.

[MSG$036397,102]
They seem to be waiting for someone.  They keep a close eye on the groups of students as they come in.

[MSG$036402,92]
Everyone seems a bit unnerved by this group hanging around, and they try to hurry past them.

[MSG$03646B,59]
I did a lot to these guys, but they haven't given up yet...

[MSG$0364AB,63]
I try to pass by the gate, pretending not to see them at all...

[MSG$0364F7,29]
Inoue "Minase. Good morning."

[MSG$03652E,50]
Inoue and others see me, and bow as they approach.

[MSG$03656D,28]
Minase "Yeah, good morning."

[MSG$0365A3,40]
Inoue "Look, you have some dust on you."

[MSG$0365E5,19]
Brushes off dust...

[MSG$036605,61]
Inoue "If you need anything at all, just ask me. Heh, heh..."

[MSG$03665C,44]
Inoue butters me up with a shit-eating grin.

[MSG$03668D,74]
What a glib talker. But he doesn't seem to have any ill will towards me...

[MSG$0366E4,25]
Minase "Yeah, all right."

[MSG$036793,29]
Then I pass by Inoue's group.

[MSG$0367BD,21]
He's one of us now...

[MSG$0367D7,49]
It looks like the balance of power has shifted...

[MSG$036815,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$0368A8,17]
The door opens...

[MSG$0368BE,36]
Imari and I go into are first class.

[MSG$0368EF,67]
There are several students already there, and Saeki is one of them.

[MSG$0369C2,23]
Saeki "Good morning..."

[MSG$0369F3,22]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$036A23,23]
Imari "Good morning..."

[MSG$036A54,50]
Saeki "You're looking very cheerful this morning."

[MSG$036AA0,70]
Saeki realizes something is wrong with Imari, and gives a faint smile.

[MSG$036AF3,41]
Saeki "Our Mistress was looking for you."

[MSG$036B36,37]
Minase "Looking for me? All right..."

[MSG$036B75,39]
Saeki "She's waiting in the infirmary."

[MSG$036BB6,37]
I drop off my bag and leave the room.

[MSG$036BF7,20]
April 27 - Classroom

[MSG$036D03,17]
The bell rings...

[MSG$036D21,36]
The bell sounds, and class begins...

[MSG$036DD6,36]
....................................

[MSG$036E07,30]
..............................

[MSG$036E32,24]
........................

[MSG$036E57,15]
...............

[MSG$036E73,9]
.........

[MSG$036E89,97]
Lunch went by just like my morning class, and soon my afternoon classes came to an end as well...

[MSG$036EF7,23]
April 27 - After school

[MSG$036F95,60]
I leave my seat and stuff my bag with whatever's on my desk.

[MSG$036FD6,48]
I'm supposed to go to the apartment again today.

[MSG$037045,66]
Imari "Minase...What are you gonna do about the art club meeting?"

[MSG$0370A1,69]
Imari walks over to me.  She's wobbling, with her cheeks flushed red.

[MSG$0370F3,110]
Minase "There's no point in going to the club now. Besides, can you even do anything the condition you're in?"

[MSG$03717C,14]
Imari "But..."

[MSG$0371A4,81]
Imari insists on staying for the club. I guess she still has the power to reason,

[MSG$0371FA,39]
and it seems to be messing up her head.

[MSG$03722E,75]
Minase "Who cares about the art club? I'm sure they'll do fine without us."

[MSG$03730F,59]
I drag Imari out of the room, even though she seems unsure.

[MSG$037357,99]
We go down the stairs, and head towards the shoe shelves. I notice someone standing in front of me.

[MSG$037401,25]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro..."

[MSG$037434,79]
Ms. Takashiro stands in front of me, almost as if she's trying to block my way.

[MSG$037490,53]
Takashiro "You're coming to the club meeting, right?"

[MSG$0374DF,29]
Minase "I'm not going today."

[MSG$037516,80]
Takashiro "You two are the officers of the art club. I won't let you slack off."

[MSG$037580,66]
Ms. Takashiro is glaring at me and speaking with ice in her voice.

[MSG$0375C7,83]
Her words are filled with authority. She's not acting at all like her usual self...

[MSG$0376A4,54]
Imari and I unwillingly follow Ms. Takashiro's orders.

[MSG$0376E7,46]
Ms. Takashiro takes me to the vacant art room.

[MSG$03771A,52]
It's too early, so none of the members are here yet.

[MSG$03775B,19]
April 27 - Art room

[MSG$037810,67]
Minase "What do you want? You brought me here for a reason, right?"

[MSG$03786D,61]
We face each other and I ask her before she can say anything.

[MSG$0378AF,51]
Of course, I already know what Ms. Takashiro wants.

[MSG$0378EF,75]
Takashiro "I suggest that you remove yourself from that group immediately."

[MSG$037954,36]
Minase "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$037993,73]
She's saying exactly what I expected, but I pretend not to know anything.

[MSG$0379E9,30]
Takashiro "Don't sidestep me!"

[MSG$037A21,65]
Takashiro "You people are trying to do something with that book!"

[MSG$037A7C,63]
Minase "Book? Do you know how dumb that sounds, Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$037AD6,52]
Takashiro "So you're going to play stupid, are you?"

[MSG$037B24,19]
Takashiro "Then..."

[MSG$037B51,5]
Bang!

[MSG$037B63,92]
Ms. Takashiro mutters under her breath.  She approaches me and snatches my bag from my hand.

[MSG$037BCC,13]
Minase "Wha?"

[MSG$037BF4,66]
She opens up the bag in front of me, and pulls out the magic book.

[MSG$037C43,80]
Takashiro "What's this? Are you still going to pretend you don't know anything?"

[MSG$037CAD,31]
Minase "Please give that back."

[MSG$037CE6,29]
I'm glaring at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$037D10,32]
Takashiro "No. I can't do that."

[MSG$037D4A,75]
Takashiro "I don't know how you got this, but you shouldn't use this power.

[MSG$037D9A,48]
If you do, it's only going to lead to disaster."

[MSG$037DE5,24]
Minase "Give it back..."

[MSG$037E17,65]
Takashiro "Wake up. It's not too late!  You can still turn back."

[MSG$037E77,23]
Minase "Give it to me!"

[MSG$037EA8,47]
I release my power, aiming it at Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$038009,4]
Bam!

[MSG$03801A,19]
Takashiro "Kyaaaa!"

[MSG$038047,100]
Ms. Takashiro is blown back by my magic.  She falls down to her knees and she knocks over the easel.

[MSG$0380B8,120]
She stays on the floor for a moment.  She looks shocked, but she shakes her head and gets up as she comes to her senses.

[MSG$03813D,83]
Takashiro "You've become a follower...But how did you get that kind of evil power?"

[MSG$0381AA,58]
Minase "Now you know who I am. Give that back to me, now!"

[MSG$0381FE,22]
Takashiro "No. Never!"

[MSG$03822F,74]
Takashiro "You don't know anything...Do you want history to repeat itself?

[MSG$03827E,47]
Do you want it to be like it was 12 years ago?"

[MSG$0382C7,47]
Takashiro "Humans can't control the dark power.

[MSG$0382FB,60]
If you aid the devil in any way, you're going to regret it!"

[MSG$038351,115]
Minase "If you're not gonna give it back, I'll take it from you by force...This time, I won't take it easy on you."

[MSG$0383DE,30]
I aim at Ms. Takashiro slowly.

[MSG$038409,84]
Takashiro "I guess it's no use talking to you. I'm afraid you leave me no choice..."

[MSG$038477,50]
Takashiro "IKZHIKAL..EDLPRNAA..BATAIVAH..RAAGIOSL.

[MSG$0384AE,66]
Behold the four flaming pentagrams as I stand alone in the midst!"

[MSG$03850A,84]
Ms. Takashiro recites some kind of spell, and a star symbol appears in front of her.

[MSG$03856B,19]
Minase "Take this!"

[MSG$038598,6]
Crack!

[MSG$03864A,80]
I launch my power, but it breaks and turns to dust before Ms. Takashiro's spell.

[MSG$0386A7,20]
Minase "What the..."

[MSG$0386D5,91]
Takashiro "You shouldn't get overconfident just because an evil imp has been bound to you."

[MSG$03874A,16]
Minase "Damn..."

[MSG$038774,71]
Takashiro "I'll get rid of this book. It shouldn't exist in this world.

[MSG$0387C0,47]
I have to burn it before more people suffer..."

[MSG$038809,59]
Takashiro "But tell me, what are you people planning to do?

[MSG$038849,52]
This power...it's not something that's easy to get."

[MSG$038897,58]
Takashiro "I can't just let you go now that I've seen it."

[MSG$0388EB,28]
Ms. Takashiro approaches me.

[MSG$038914,33]
Then I signal Imari with my eyes.

[MSG$03893A,57]
Ms. Takashiro isn't paying any attention to Imari at all.

[MSG$038980,77]
She obviously has no idea that her most trusted student is going to harm her.

[MSG$0389D2,44]
I'm sure Imari can take out Ms. Takashiro...

[MSG$038A0B,73]
Imari hesitates for a second, but then she jumps to attack Ms. Takashiro.

[MSG$038AB2,33]
Imari "I'm sorry, Ms. Takashiro!"

[MSG$038AED,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$038B18,47]
Imari's thin leg swings up high off the ground,

[MSG$038B4C,36]
slams into Ms. Takashiro diagonally.

[MSG$038C15,5]
Bash!

[MSG$038C27,16]
Takashiro "Gha!"

[MSG$038C51,72]
Ms. Takashiro takes the hit square, and her body bends all the way over.

[MSG$038C9E,69]
But even after taking that severe blow, she manages to keep standing.

[MSG$038CE8,38]
She must have extraordinary willpower.

[MSG$038D1B,27]
Takashiro "Imari..you too?"

[MSG$038D50,35]
Imari "Why don't you just go down!"

[MSG$038D8D,53]
Imari is about to cry.  She lands the finishing blow.

[MSG$038E67,6]
Doosh!

[MSG$038E7A,59]
Imari throws a punch right where she landed her first kick.

[MSG$038EBA,73]
Ms. Takashiro can't take anymore.  She falls on the floor, fainting away.

[MSG$038F94,17]
She falls down...

[MSG$038FB2,25]
Minase "Good job, Imari."

[MSG$038FE5,11]
I pat Imari

[MSG$038FF5,17]
|on her shoulder.

[MSG$03900B,27]
Now Imari is an accomplice.

[MSG$039033,86]
Minase "You go and get Ms. Kitami. I'll tie up Ms. Takashiro, so that she can't move."

[MSG$0390A3,52]
Imari "What are you going to do with Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$0390F1,38]
Minase "I don't know. Ask Ms. Kitami."

[MSG$039131,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$039149,70]
As Imari leaves the art room, I tie up Ms. Takashiro's hands and feet.

[MSG$0391ED,41]
Imari comes back quickly with Ms. Kitami.

[MSG$039223,32]
Kitami "I see things went well."

[MSG$03925D,45]
Minase "What shall we do with Ms. Takashiro?"

[MSG$0392A4,66]
Kitami "We'll take her to the apartment. Then I'll entertain her."

[MSG$039300,51]
Kitami "Looks like it's going to be a fun night..."

[MSG$03934D,34]
Ms. Kitami is grinning ear to ear.

[MSG$03937C,73]
Kitami "I'm going to get the car and take Ms. Takashiro to the apartment.

[MSG$0393CA,91]
You two stop by the apartment later. Tonight we'll have a welcome party for Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$03943F,22]
Minase "I understand."

[MSG$03946F,23]
Kitami "See you later."

[MSG$0394A0,54]
Ms. Kitami picks up Ms. Takashiro and leaves the room.

[MSG$0394E3,83]
I pick up the book Ms. Takashiro dropped, clean the art room, and leave with Imari.

[MSG$0395AB,25]
April 27 - Leaving school

[MSG$03966E,85]
Tonight, Ms. Takashiro becomes our prey...I'm getting excited just thinking about it.

[MSG$0396C8,69]
I'm getting hard picturing the resolute Ms. Takashiro all dirtied up.

[MSG$03971A,41]
Imari "You're going there again tonight?"

[MSG$03975D,40]
Minase "Yeah. You're coming too, right?"

[MSG$03979F,14]
Imari "Yes..."

[MSG$0397C7,40]
Imari seems a bit puzzled, but she nods.

[MSG$0397FC,81]
Imari "Can you go ahead without me, Minase? I'll just go home and get changed..."

[MSG$039867,47]
Minase "Why don't we just head over there now?"

[MSG$0398B0,38]
Imari "But my underpants are dirty..."

[MSG$0398F0,40]
Imari says this while averting her eyes.

[MSG$03991D,56]
So that's why she's looking at her skirt all the time...

[MSG$039962,90]
She's been hit by the drugs and holding a vibrator in there all day, so I don't blame her.

[MSG$0399C1,37]
But she's gonna take them off anyway,

[MSG$0399EB,46]
so there's really no need to worry about it...

[MSG$039A1E,65]
She's a girl so I guess I'll let her do what she wants for now...

[MSG$039A6C,35]
Minase "All right...Make it quick."

[MSG$039AA9,13]
Imari "Okay."

[MSG$039AF4,35]
Imari and I part, as she goes home.

[MSG$039B24,41]
I head over to the apartment by myself...
