[MSG$000150,2]
Не

[MSG$00016F,3]
Ага

[MSG$000197,37]
Make him run through the school naked

[MSG$0001D9,41]
Humiliate him in front of the school gate

[MSG$000227,20]
Go the basement room

[MSG$000260,26]
Wake her up more violently

[MSG$000297,31]
Play a prank to get back at her

[MSG$0002DB,17]
Give in to Kitami

[MSG$000309,13]
Reject Kitami

[MSG$00033B,19]
Have her swallow it

[MSG$00036B,17]
Come all over her

[MSG$0003A1,17]
Give in to Kitami

[MSG$0003CF,13]
Ignore Kitami

[MSG$0003F9,13]
Turn her down

[MSG$00056E,18]
April 24 - Morning

[MSG$00064E,18]
Imari "Wake up..."

[MSG$00067A,23]
Imari "It's morning..."

[MSG$0006AB,63]
Imari "Jeez, why does it have to be this way every single day?"

[MSG$000704,37]
Imari "Come on, get up this instant!"

[MSG$000743,25]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$0007F9,43]
Imari "Oh, man...I guess I have no choice."

[MSG$00083E,52]
Imari rummages under the bed and picks something up.

[MSG$00087F,19]
Imari "Here it is!"

[MSG$0008AC,29]
What was under the bed again?

[MSG$0008D6,57]
Imari "I'd better be careful not to mess up this time..."

[MSG$000929,102]
Imari "Let's see, since you're supposed to turn it in opposite direction of the screws, that means..."

[MSG$0009A9,82]
Muttering all the while, Imari slips something around my leg, just like yesterday.

[MSG$000AA3,9]
Ghaaa...!

[MSG$000AB9,46]
Instantly I shove away my blanket and jump up.

[MSG$000AF4,37]
Minase "What the hell are you doing?"

[MSG$000B33,12]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$000B59,36]
Imari "I haven't done anything yet."

[MSG$000B97,18]
As if I'd let her!

[MSG$000BB6,58]
Besides, I can see that she's got the voltage wrong again!

[MSG$000BF5,70]
Is she one of those people who's never even used a screwdriver before?

[MSG$000C48,51]
Imari "But it's great that you got up on your own!"

[MSG$000C95,83]
If she's going to wake me up with that torture device, I'd rather not sleep at all.

[MSG$000CED,68]
I'd better hide that contraption somewhere by the end of the day....

[MSG$000D3E,41]
Imari "What an unbelievable device, huh?"

[MSG$000D81,34]
You're the one who's unbelievable!

[MSG$000DB0,26]
April 24 - Going to School

[MSG$000E55,36]
Imari and I walk to school together.

[MSG$000E86,49]
Imari "You're really popular these days, Minase."

[MSG$000ED1,45]
Imari brings up this subject all of a sudden.

[MSG$000F0B,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$000F32,63]
Imari "You're always being surrounded during every study hall."

[MSG$000F8B,113]
Come to think of it, ever since that incident with Murai, all these girls keep coming up to me during study hall,

[MSG$001001,33]
hoping I'll cast spells for them.

[MSG$00102F,109]
Needless to say, I always turn them down. I can't take all their requests or I'll never be through with them.

[MSG$0010A1,60]
Besides, I've got to avoid generating any more weird gossip.

[MSG$0010EA,44]
Minase "It's just a pain in the ass for me."

[MSG$001130,43]
Imari "Liar...you know you're enjoying it!"

[MSG$001175,64]
Imari "I don't know, you're acting pretty strange these days..."

[MSG$0011CF,81]
Imari "Always reading weird books, practicing black magic...it's really strange."

[MSG$00123A,60]
Minase "So what? It's not like I'm causing you any trouble."

[MSG$001290,21]
Imari "Yes, you are!"

[MSG$0012BF,26]
Imari "Oh, yes you are..."

[MSG$0012F3,85]
Imari "These days, it's getting harder and harder to get you out of bed, and also..."

[MSG$001362,61]
Who's she to talk? Imari's acting pretty weird herself today.

[MSG$0013A4,66]
I guess she's still holding a grudge from what happened yesterday.

[MSG$0013F3,51]
Minase "I'm guessing you've got your period today."

[MSG$0014D9,4]
Bam!

[MSG$0014EA,17]
Imari "You jerk!"

[MSG$001515,54]
Imari "The heck with you, anyway! I'm going on ahead!"

[MSG$001565,28]
With that, Imari storms off.

[MSG$001586,21]
I was only kidding...

[MSG$0015A8,17]
April 24 - Locker

[MSG$001696,44]
I happen to see Nonogusa in the locker area.

[MSG$0016C7,39]
Nonogusa notices me too and looks over.

[MSG$0016FB,52]
Nonogusa gives me a glance, then quickly looks away.

[MSG$001760,29]
It's a very awkward moment...

[MSG$00178A,53]
She might've guessed that I stole some of the photos.

[MSG$0017C4,56]
But it's too late for me to give them back to her now...

[MSG$00183B,24]
Imari "What's going on?"

[MSG$00186D,17]
Minase "Nothing."

[MSG$0018D1,44]
I happen to see Nonogusa at the locker area.

[MSG$001902,39]
Nonogusa notices me too and looks over.

[MSG$001936,32]
Nonogusa "Good morning, Minase."

[MSG$001971,22]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$0019A1,36]
I return Nonogusa's cheery greeting.

[MSG$0019D2,36]
Nonogusa "Thanks for the other day."

[MSG$001A10,20]
Minase "No problem."

[MSG$001A62,39]
She smiles at me and goes off to class.

[MSG$001B19,24]
Imari "What's going on?"

[MSG$001B4B,98]
Imari "Wasn't that Nonogusa? That girl you used to always pick on? Giving her horrible nicknames?"

[MSG$001BC7,14]
Minase "Yeah."

[MSG$001BEF,39]
Imari "So what happened the other day?"

[MSG$001C30,68]
Minase "She was getting picked on, so I helped her out, that's all."

[MSG$001C8E,35]
Imari "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$001CCB,90]
Imari "Hey, that reminds me, I heard Nonogusa-san's going to be the new swim team captain.

[MSG$001D2A,36]
One my friends on the team told me."

[MSG$001D68,16]
Minase "Really?"

[MSG$001D92,63]
It sounds like those photos were more effective than I thought.

[MSG$001DDE,20]
April 24 - Classroom

[MSG$001E71,75]
When I get to my classroom, there are already a few other students there...

[MSG$001EC1,20]
Saeki's one of them.

[MSG$001F14,21]
Saeki "Good morning."

[MSG$001F43,49]
Saeki greets me as if nothing happened yesterday.

[MSG$001F79,47]
So she's got her school face on at school, huh?

[MSG$001FCE,54]
Minase "Okay, why don't you give it back to me, then?"

[MSG$00201E,61]
I hold out my hand, intending to get my book back from Saeki.

[MSG$002068,71]
Saeki "Could you wait a little longer? Don't worry, I have it with me."

[MSG$0020C9,19]
Saeki taps her bag.

[MSG$0020E1,25]
True, her bag is bulging.

[MSG$002107,50]
Minase "Well, give it back by the end of the day."

[MSG$002153,37]
With that, I head toward my own seat.

[MSG$00217D,85]
What the hell, as long as she brought it with her, I'll just wait until after school.

[MSG$0021E5,14]
Minase "Okay."

[MSG$00220D,64]
I try to look as indifferent as possible, and go to my own seat.

[MSG$0022B0,61]
Murai "Hey, Minase, I want you to cast another spell for me."

[MSG$002308,37]
The second I do, Murai pounces on me.

[MSG$00233A,16]
Here it comes...

[MSG$00234F,75]
At first I liked getting all the attention, but now it's a pain in the ass.

[MSG$0023A7,46]
Minase "I just did one for you the other day."

[MSG$0023EF,72]
Murai "Well, the thing is, for a virile guy he finishes way too fast..."

[MSG$002451,83]
Murai "So I was wondering if...if you had a spell that would make him last longer."

[MSG$0024BE,55]
Murai clasps her hands together in a beseeching manner.

[MSG$0024FA,90]
What the hell does she want me to do, anyway? If he comes too fast, then tie up his prick!

[MSG$002561,43]
Minase "Sorry...I'm not in the mood today."

[MSG$0025A6,101]
I say this in a disgusted tone. Of course, I have no intention of ever casting a spell for her again.

[MSG$002618,57]
If I did as she asked, I'd soon be swamped with requests.

[MSG$002656,78]
Why the hell should I have to listen to someone bitching about their sex life?

[MSG$0026E3,46]
Murai "Whaaa? Minase, you're just being mean!"

[MSG$00272B,64]
Minase "Go ask Saeki to help you out with that kind of problem."

[MSG$002785,74]
Murai "Can't you see I'm asking you because I respect your power? Please!"

[MSG$0027E9,41]
To be blunt, it's a huge pain in the ass.

[MSG$002817,47]
I ignore Murai and put my head down on my desk.

[MSG$002853,17]
Minase "Zzzzz..."

[MSG$00287E,44]
Murai "Come on, don't pretend to be asleep!"

[MSG$0028C4,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0028DD,16]
Murai "Come on!"

[MSG$0029F1,24]
Eventually class starts.

[MSG$002AD4,16]
April 24 - Lunch

[MSG$002B6B,37]
The bell rings and lunch hour begins.

[MSG$002B9D,41]
Girl 1 "Hey, Minase, let's eat together."

[MSG$002BE0,14]
Girl "Me too!"

[MSG$002C08,79]
Imari had been on her way to my desk with her little lunchbox in her hands, but

[MSG$002C5C,69]
she sees what's happening and goes back to her own desk, looking sad.

[MSG$002CAE,36]
Things have changed for me, somehow.

[MSG$002CD7,65]
In recent days it feels as though I've started to lose control...

[MSG$002D25,89]
These girls who've started surrounding me...you can tell they're only trying to get on my

[MSG$002D83,53]
|good side, because I've suddenly become a hot topic.

[MSG$002DC5,87]
I'll bet they're only thinking it might come in handy sometime to have me for a friend.

[MSG$002E21,39]
I'd take Imari over this bunch any day.

[MSG$002E55,53]
I take the lunch my sister made for me out of my bag.

[MSG$002E8F,84]
I see those girls dragging their chairs over to my desk, clutching their lunchboxes.

[MSG$002EF0,16]
Minase "(sighs)"

[MSG$002F1A,99]
It's not that I don't like the idea of eating with the girls. But for some reason it makes me sigh.

[MSG$002F8A,5]
Slam!

[MSG$002FA4,116]
Just then, the door slams open, shattering the lunchtime peace. A group of guys is muscling their way into the room.

[MSG$003025,32]
Instantly, the room grows quiet.

[MSG$003052,57]
These guys are part of our school's most notorious gangs.

[MSG$003090,83]
They're stereotypical delinquents, now a rare sight on co-ed campuses such as ours.

[MSG$0030E8,40]
I hear they pretty much rule the school.

[MSG$00311D,54]
Some idiot must've rubbed these jerks the wrong way...

[MSG$003160,85]
I've heard they do drugs, too. It's safer not to get involved with the likes of them.

[MSG$0031BA,76]
These thugs will pick a fight with you at the drop of a hat. On top of that,

[MSG$00320B,85]
I've heard they do drugs, too. It's safer not to get involved with the likes of them.

[MSG$00326D,19]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$00328D,65]
They're headed my way, kicking aside all nearby desks and chairs.

[MSG$0032DB,42]
An arrogant guy named Inoue leads the way.

[MSG$00330A,64]
He looks pretty tough, but there's no telling if he really is...

[MSG$003357,85]
But who the hell could it be? The moron who's going to get dragged away by this gang?

[MSG$003434,37]
Inoue "Are you Minase? Come with us."

[MSG$003473,22]
Huh? They're after ME?

[MSG$003496,61]
Girl 1 "Oh, sorry, I just remembered something I have to do."

[MSG$0034ED,25]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$003513,19]
Girl 2 "Me, too..."

[MSG$003540,25]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$003566,75]
All at once, the girls who'd been surrounding me scatter in all directions.

[MSG$0035B6,19]
Like, thanks a lot!

[MSG$0035D6,42]
Minase "I think you've got the wrong guy."

[MSG$00361A,37]
I say this to Inoue in a timid voice.

[MSG$003644,82]
I don't remember ever picking a fight with them, or getting baited by them either.

[MSG$0036A3,31]
Inoue "Aren't you Taki Minase?"

[MSG$0036FC,14]
Minase "No..."

[MSG$003724,16]
I reply timidly.

[MSG$003741,45]
Inoue "Then who the hell is this Minase guy?"

[MSG$003788,24]
Minase "I don't know..."

[MSG$0037BA,28]
Desperately I avert my gaze.

[MSG$0037E3,90]
No way am I going to get away with a lame lie like that. But maybe I can stall for time...

[MSG$00384A,25]
Inoue "Then what's that?"

[MSG$00387D,32]
Inoue is staring at my lunchbox.

[MSG$0038A2,58]
The name ''Taki Minase'' is written in huge letters on it.

[MSG$0038E9,7]
Darn...

[MSG$0038FD,75]
My sister wrote that against my wishes, so no one would take it by mistake.

[MSG$003955,40]
Inoue "Are you messing with me or what?"

[MSG$003997,7]
Shit...

[MSG$0039AB,22]
Inoue "Take him away!'

[MSG$0039E6,15]
Minase "Yes..."

[MSG$003A0F,18]
I answer honestly.

[MSG$003A2E,32]
Inoue "Then there's no mistake."

[MSG$003A68,28]
I guess they are after me...

[MSG$003A89,107]
What should I do? I can't use magic to get out of this. Plus, I have no confidence when it comes to fights.

[MSG$003B01,22]
Inoue "Take him away!"

[MSG$003B55,67]
With that, the gang surrounds me and drags me out of the classroom.

[MSG$003BD7,39]
Imari "What do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$003C18,15]
April 24 - Roof

[MSG$003CB2,33]
The gang drags me up to the roof.

[MSG$003D5B,58]
Inoue "Listen, punk, do you know why we brought you here?"

[MSG$003DAF,16]
I shake my head.

[MSG$003DCC,35]
Minase "What did I ever do to you?"

[MSG$003E09,64]
I'm perfectly aware that it will do me no good to ask them that.

[MSG$003E4E,37]
Jerks like these don't need a reason.

[MSG$003E80,86]
For them, this is no more than a way to kill time, something to do when they're bored.

[MSG$003EDB,41]
But I wish I knew why they'd picked me...

[MSG$003F11,64]
Inoue "I hear you're popular with the girls these days, Minase!"

[MSG$003F6B,108]
Inoue "We've heard all the rumors. You've become the big man on campus using Black Magic, isn't that right?"

[MSG$003FF1,70]
Inoue "What are you gonna do? Summon a demon and take over the world?"

[MSG$004051,43]
The guys behind him snicker at these words.

[MSG$004081,40]
Who knew the rumors had spread this far?

[MSG$0040B6,56]
Inoue "We want you to show us, see. Show us your power!"

[MSG$004108,17]
Minase "(chokes)"

[MSG$004133,45]
Inoue "You're an eyesore...a moron like you."

[MSG$00417A,74]
Inoue "Thanks to your spells, we've been hearing all kinds of complaints."

[MSG$0041DE,46]
Inoue "What are you gonna do about that, huh?"

[MSG$004226,43]
They're talking about the Murai incident...

[MSG$00425E,60]
After Murai, I'd cast the same spell for a bunch of girls...

[MSG$00429F,98]
It's not surprising that some people would bear a grudge against me, hearing about my Black Magic.

[MSG$00430E,84]
The guy Murai was after...I'd forced him to break up with his girlfriend, after all,

[MSG$004367,32]
I'm sure she's got it in for me.

[MSG$0043AF,49]
Inoue "And besides, I can't stand guys like you."

[MSG$0043FA,101]
Inoue "Dweebs like you who get off on something like Black Magic, Just looking at you pisses me off."

[MSG$004479,44]
Inoue "Plus I'm in a really bad mood today."

[MSG$0044BF,115]
Inoue "I stepped in dog shit on my way here this morning...I got a ticket for parking my bike in front of my house,

[MSG$004537,31]
so now my license's suspended!"

[MSG$004570,67]
Inoue "And it's all because of you. So now I'm gonna make you pay!"

[MSG$0045CD,34]
What the hell is he talking about?

[MSG$0045FC,76]
Inoue "So that's the deal. Don't blame me, you only have yourself to blame!"

[MSG$004668,57]
Inoue "Also...I hear you're going out with Rika Shiraki!"

[MSG$0046BB,65]
Inoue spits this out at me with an even scarier look on his face.

[MSG$004701,31]
Where did that rumor come from?

[MSG$00472D,68]
Inoue "Someone saw you feeling Shiraki's breasts behind the school."

[MSG$00478B,18]
So someone saw us.

[MSG$0047AA,49]
Inoue "I've never even touched them yet, dammit!"

[MSG$0047F5,74]
Inoue "How dare you put your hands on the tits of our Idol...You're dead!"

[MSG$004859,88]
Inoue "I wanna massage those tits of Shiraki's too, see? Know what I'm saying, asshole?"

[MSG$0048CB,48]
Inoue's fists are trembling. He's way serious...

[MSG$004908,44]
Inoue "So how far did you get with Shiraki?"

[MSG$00494E,53]
Inoue "Don't tell me you went all the way, dickhead!"

[MSG$00499D,45]
Inoue asks me this as he cracks his knuckles.

[MSG$0049CF,45]
Depending on my answer, I could get killed...

[MSG$004A09,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$004A22,69]
Inoue "I know you massaged her tits. Don't tell me nothing happened!"

[MSG$004A81,47]
Inoue "Tell me exactly what went down, dammit!"

[MSG$004ACA,72]
Inoue "Depending on what you tell me...you're going to be in deep shit."

[MSG$004B2C,67]
It's a threat. It's like he's telling me not to tell him the truth.

[MSG$004B74,57]
At any rate, I've got to talk my way out of this somehow.

[MSG$004BBA,72]
Inoue "I hear you two went into the storage room in the gym after that."

[MSG$004C1C,7]
Shit...

[MSG$004C28,36]
I had no idea someone had seen THAT.

[MSG$004C59,50]
Inoue "Now what were doing in there, huh, Minase?"

[MSG$004CA5,69]
Inoue "You weren't having a friendly calisthenics session, were you?"

[MSG$004D04,19]
Minase "You see..."

[MSG$004D31,116]
Inoue "Tell me the truth. No matter what you say, you signed your own death sentence when you massaged her breasts."

[MSG$004DBF,22]
Minase "Hey, come on!"

[MSG$004DEF,47]
Inoue "Tell me, dammit! Did you or didn't you?"

[MSG$004E38,17]
Minase "I...I..."

[MSG$004E63,80]
What have I got to lose now? No matter what I say, he's going to kill me anyway.

[MSG$004EC0,15]
Minase "I did."

[MSG$004EE9,7]
Snap...

[MSG$004EFD,39]
Inoue loses it when he hears my answer.

[MSG$004F31,27]
Inoue "I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$004F66,67]
Inoue "You bastard, I was supposed to be Rika Shiraki's first time,

[MSG$004FAE,54]
don't you know that's what I decided a long time ago?"

[MSG$004FFE,33]
Inoue "Beat the crap out of him!"

[MSG$005039,37]
All at once, the whole gang jumps me.

[MSG$005100,4]
Pow!

[MSG$005111,17]
Minase "(chokes)"

[MSG$00513C,74]
Nobody's pulling any punches, and I go flying. I'm pummeled to the ground.

[MSG$00518B,55]
Sparks are going off inside my head, and I'm in a daze.

[MSG$005268,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00527B,15]
Minase "(gags)"

[MSG$0052A4,59]
Now that I'm on the ground, I'm getting kicked mercilessly.

[MSG$0052EC,45]
Thug 1 "Don't mess with us, you little punk!"

[MSG$0053CB,6]
Whack!

[MSG$0053DE,15]
Minase "(gags)"

[MSG$005407,67]
Thug 2 "You little dweeb! Why don't you just go home and jerk off!"

[MSG$0054FD,17]
Being pummeled...

[MSG$0055B0,6]
Whack!

[MSG$0055C3,97]
I'm helpless. I have no choice but to let them pound away at me, and just try to endure the pain.

[MSG$005631,59]
Inoue "Dammit, get up, Minase! It's too early for bedtime!"

[MSG$005686,38]
With that Inoue forces me to stand up.

[MSG$0056B9,94]
Inoue "Don't think you're gonna get off with a little beating like this. We're gonna make sure

[MSG$00571C,49]
|we put you in the hospital for at least a week."

[MSG$005767,51]
Inoue smirks when he sees the suffering on my face.

[MSG$00579F,42]
He draws back his fist to strike me again.

[MSG$0057D6,26]
Imari "Stop it right now!"

[MSG$00580A,57]
All of a sudden, a voice reverberates across the rooftop.

[MSG$0058AE,17]
Minase "Imari..."

[MSG$0058D9,45]
I whisper her name when I see who just spoke.

[MSG$005913,23]
Imari's standing there.

[MSG$00592F,26]
She's glaring at the guys.

[MSG$00594E,43]
She must've come up here, worried about me.

[MSG$005986,110]
I know it's lame to have a girl stand up for me, but at this moment, there's no sweeter sight for sore eyes...

[MSG$005A01,29]
Inoue "Who the hell are you?"

[MSG$005A38,105]
Inoue shoves me aside. He stands there glaring suspiciously at this brash-looking girl who just appeared.

[MSG$005AAE,29]
Imari "That kid's classmate."

[MSG$005AE5,39]
Inoue "So what do you want, Classmate?"

[MSG$005B26,54]
Imari "3 against 1? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?"

[MSG$005B76,101]
Inoue "Nope, it doesn't bother me at all. Anyway, I could take a guy like him on my own, no problem."

[MSG$005BF5,103]
Just listen to him...Although it's true that I don't think I have a chance against him even one-on-one.

[MSG$005C61,84]
These guys are always fighting, so someone like me must be mere clay in their hands.

[MSG$005CC2,69]
Imari "If you don't stop beating up on him, I'll take you on myself!"

[MSG$005D21,70]
Imari stands in front of the gang and makes this gallant proclamation.

[MSG$005D74,82]
I'm sure it would be a comical sight to someone who didn't know what was going on.

[MSG$005DCB,59]
3 guys against 1 girl. Plus they're way bigger than she is.

[MSG$005E69,80]
Inoue "Hey, listen! Don't think just because you're a girl that I won't hit you.

[MSG$005EBE,66]
Sorry, but I'm no feminist. I don't have a problem hitting girls."

[MSG$005F1A,40]
The guys look insulted by Imari's words.

[MSG$005F47,35]
They have no idea how tough she is.

[MSG$005F77,114]
Imari's been taking shorinji kempo lessons since she was small. My parents forced me to take lessons with her too,

[MSG$005FEE,36]
but I didn't stick with it for long.

[MSG$00601F,75]
Imari always finished what she starts, so she's been practicing ever since.

[MSG$00606F,37]
She's even won a national tournament.

[MSG$0060A1,69]
She's got what it takes to make short work of your average male thug.

[MSG$0060F3,98]
Imari "Fine by me. Besides, if you try to hold back I might really do some serious damage to you."

[MSG$00616F,43]
Inoue "Listen to you shoot off your mouth."

[MSG$0061B4,64]
Inoue "Hey, make this stupid little bitch grovel on the ground!"

[MSG$00620E,29]
Thug 1 "Just leave it to me."

[MSG$006245,56]
One of the thugs advances with a nasty leer on his face.

[MSG$0062EE,50]
Imari "Don't underestimate me because I'm a girl."

[MSG$00633A,67]
Thug 1 "No sweat, after I knock you out, I'm gonna lick your tits."

[MSG$006397,69]
He grins lewdly at Imari as he advances, fists aimed at Imari's face.

[MSG$006481,6]
Whack!

[MSG$006494,69]
Imari casually deflects his right hook with a chop of her right hand.

[MSG$0064E6,91]
Then she balls that hand into a fist, and pummels the thug in the face with blinding force.

[MSG$0065E7,5]
Slam!

[MSG$0065F9,15]
Thug 1 "Ugh..."

[MSG$006646,60]
With a sickening thud, her fist sinks into the thug's cheek.

[MSG$006687,66]
The thug covers his face with both hands, then sinks to his knees.

[MSG$0066D6,31]
Blood squirts from his fingers.

[MSG$006734,28]
Imari "What did I tell you?"

[MSG$0067BB,56]
Imari waves her right hand with a cool look on her face.

[MSG$0067F8,57]
So it's the guy who's ended up groveling on the ground...

[MSG$00683E,73]
Imari "Forgot to mention that I'm a black belt in shorinji kempo. Sorry!"

[MSG$0068F7,21]
Inoue "You little..."

[MSG$006926,85]
Seeing his crony knocked down with a single punch, Inoue begins to tremble with rage.

[MSG$006988,63]
Inoue "Shorinji kempo or not, you're still nothing but a girl."

[MSG$0069E1,78]
Inoue "We got all our training on the streets. We'll show you the difference!"

[MSG$006A49,63]
Inoue motions with his eyes, and the other guy slowly advances.

[MSG$006A8D,88]
Despite Inoue's tough talk, this thug is clearly rattled by what he just saw from Imari.

[MSG$006B56,27]
Thug 2 "Go to hell, bitch!"

[MSG$006BDC,73]
He rushes toward Imari menacingly, and unleashes a full-on kick at Imari.

[MSG$006C2A,78]
You can hear the sound of his boot slicing the air in an arc towards her body.

[MSG$006C85,46]
But at the last second, Imari dodges the blow.

[MSG$006CC0,56]
The thug's kick misses its target, and he loses balance.

[MSG$006D05,102]
Without a moment's hesitation, Imari aims a kick of her own at his side, which is wide open to attack.

[MSG$006D78,91]
Making a half-turn with her left foot, her other foot sails through the air in a clean arc,

[MSG$006DD8,51]
and she sinks her frail-looking foot into his side.

[MSG$006EB0,5]
Thud!

[MSG$006EC2,12]
Thug 2 "!!!"

[MSG$006EFF,120]
The thug doesn't even have time to yell before he goes flying through the air sideways. Soon he's rolling on the ground.

[MSG$006FB6,58]
Imari "You're so lame. What happened to all that bluster?"

[MSG$00700A,42]
Imari stands there brushing off her hands.

[MSG$0070C4,11]
Inoue "..."

[MSG$0070E9,60]
Inoue is staring in disbelief at the two guys on the ground.

[MSG$007132,24]
Inoue "What the hell..."

[MSG$007164,31]
Imari "Now there's only you..."

[MSG$00719D,54]
Imari "What's it gonna be? Do you want to take me on?"

[MSG$0071ED,42]
Imari is confident as she asks Inoue this.

[MSG$00721C,43]
Clearly, their fortunes have been reversed.

[MSG$007254,50]
Inoue "Damn right I do! I'm not backing down now!"

[MSG$0072A0,59]
Inoue "Hey, how long are you gonna stay down? Help me out!"

[MSG$00734A,54]
The first thug struggles to his feet at Inoue's words.

[MSG$007385,68]
They signal to each other with their eyes, and turn on Imari as one.

[MSG$0073D6,23]
Inoue "Take this, you!"

[MSG$007458,64]
Even though it's 2 on 1, Imari stays calm as she makes her move.

[MSG$0074A5,93]
First she sets herself for the first guy's attack, and deflects his fist. Then she blocks the

[MSG$007507,51]
|other guy's kick--from behind her-- from the knee.

[MSG$007547,62]
The sound of physical contact reverberates across the rooftop.

[MSG$007592,60]
Imari "That's really low, you know...2 guys against 1 girl."

[MSG$0075E8,65]
Having dodged their attacks, Imari falls back, still in position.

[MSG$007636,76]
Inoue "This isn't about being low or fair. All that matters is that we win."

[MSG$00769C,31]
With that, they rush her again.

[MSG$0076C8,11]
Imari "Oh?"

[MSG$0076ED,52]
That's all Imari says as she swiftly braces herself.

[MSG$00772E,60]
The two guys are rushing her from the front and from behind.

[MSG$00776F,100]
Imari sets herself to take on the frontal assault while keeping her eyes on the attacker behind her.

[MSG$0077E0,40]
The guy behind her makes his move first.

[MSG$007815,99]
Closing the gap between them in an instant, he feints a jab, then unleashes a full-on punch towards

[MSG$00787D,14]
|Imari's face,

[MSG$007898,99]
Without batting an eyelid, Imari deflects the punch with one arm, then as the guy lunges to attack,

[MSG$007900,65]
she delivers a blow to his neck putting all her weight behind it,

[MSG$0079E7,51]
It's a knockout punch. Gagging, the thug goes down.

[MSG$007A74,55]
But Imari has no time to rest, as Inoue makes his move.

[MSG$007AB8,40]
He's going to blindside her with a kick.

[MSG$007AED,108]
She senses him coming and quickly turns to face him, but by that time he's already within striking distance.

[MSG$007B66,89]
She manages to deflect the kick while off-balance. But Inoue's kick is so well-aimed that

[MSG$007BC4,32]
she can't deflect it completely.

[MSG$007BF1,12]
Imari "Ugh!"

[MSG$007C17,68]
Imari's face contorts with pain as she absorbs the shock of contact.

[MSG$007C68,63]
She glares at him and uncharacteristically takes the offensive.

[MSG$007CB4,29]
She rushes in under his arms.

[MSG$007CD6,28]
The gap between them closes.

[MSG$007CFF,12]
Imari "Hah!"

[MSG$007DBD,89]
Lowering her center of gravity, she bends her knees, and catapults herself against Inoue.

[MSG$007E1B,20]
There's a dull thud,

[MSG$007E3C,77]
Inoue is elbowed in the chest. He gasps for air as he bends his body forward.

[MSG$007F2F,69]
|Imari elbows him, then backhands his face, which is leaning forward.

[MSG$007F81,96]
The elbowing and the backhand punch are delivered smoothly and with merciless destructive force.

[MSG$008012,45]
Without a word, Inoue crumples to the ground.

[MSG$0080CF,46]
Imari "Oh, man, you didn't even challenge me."

[MSG$008117,85]
Imari scoffs at Inoue and puts her hands on her hips. She sighs in a resigned manner.

[MSG$008171,67]
She's barely out of breath, even though she took on all those guys.

[MSG$0081C1,55]
I've been watching all this with my mouth hanging open.

[MSG$008205,95]
I never dreamed she had moves like those. I hadn't seen her do kempo in a while, but she's even

[MSG$008269,42]
|more lethal now than she ever was before.

[MSG$0082A0,116]
Right now she looks just like any ordinary girl, but then girls who go through ruthless training are to be feared...

[MSG$008321,47]
Inoue "You bitch...I swear I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$00836A,60]
Inoue struggles to his feet with a look of pain on his face.

[MSG$0083AB,84]
Then he pulls a switchblade out of his pocket, and flicks out the blade with a snap.

[MSG$00843E,91]
Imari "You mean you can't take on a girl unless you have a weapon like that in your hands?"

[MSG$0084B3,22]
Imari looks disgusted.

[MSG$0084D6,25]
Inoue "Shut the hell up!"

[MSG$008509,39]
Apparently he can't think up an excuse.

[MSG$00853D,72]
Inoue "I'm gonna use this on your face so I never have to see it again!"

[MSG$00859F,64]
With an evil smile, he advances towards Imari, waving the knife.

[MSG$0085EC,80]
There's cold sweat on his brow. Inoue must really be at the end of his rope now.

[MSG$008641,79]
With Imari's unexpected arrival, he and his posse have fallen completely apart.

[MSG$00869D,53]
But even Imari is unnerved by the sight of the knife.

[MSG$0086D7,61]
If Inoue's got a knife, she's definitely at a disadvantage...

[MSG$008721,23]
Man "Stop right there."

[MSG$008752,44]
Just then, there's a voice from the doorway.

[MSG$0087E1,30]
We all look towards the voice.

[MSG$008804,43]
A big, muscular guy is striding towards us.

[MSG$008834,48]
From the looks of him, no way is he on our side.

[MSG$008871,16]
Inoue "Shinjou!"

[MSG$00889B,23]
Inoue calls out to him.

[MSG$0088BF,79]
So this is Shinjou...the leader of this gang here, the guy who runs the school.

[MSG$008913,28]
A.K.A. Shinjou the Repeater.

[MSG$008934,64]
He's a notorious delinquent who rarely shows his face at school.

[MSG$008981,34]
Apparently he's in school today...

[MSG$0089A8,77]
He only shows up when he feels like it. I haven't seen him in a while myself.

[MSG$008A02,115]
Rumor has it that his dad's a city councilman, which is why he's escaped expulsion despite his many transgressions.

[MSG$008A82,51]
Shinjou "She really did a number on you guys, huh?"

[MSG$008ACF,70]
Shinjou looks around at the guys on the ground, still moaning in pain.

[MSG$008B22,101]
Inoue "That's because...see...we went easy on her because she's a girl, and this is what happened..."

[MSG$008BA1,73]
I'm sure it would've happened even if they hadn't ''gone easy on her''...

[MSG$008BEF,44]
Shinjou slowly turns his gaze towards Imari.

[MSG$008C28,73]
Shinjou "Little girl, I think you've pushed your luck a little too much."

[MSG$008C8B,59]
Shinjou looks down on Imari, his eyes icy, as he says this.

[MSG$008CD3,56]
Imari "They're the ones who picked the fight, you know."

[MSG$008D25,67]
Imari looks right back at Shinjou as she flings this retort at him.

[MSG$008D75,43]
Shinjou "Oh, yeah? Well, sorry about that."

[MSG$008DBA,26]
Shinjou laughs derisively.

[MSG$008DE1,72]
Shinjou "To show you just how sorry I am, why don't I take you on next?"

[MSG$008E43,48]
So saying, Shinjou starts cracking his knuckles.

[MSG$008E78,44]
When this guy does it, he sure looks fierce.

[MSG$008F07,54]
Imari continues to stare at Shinjou without flinching.

[MSG$008F4A,44]
Imari "I hear you're a really good fighter."

[MSG$008F90,96]
Imari's right; I've heard the rumors too. Apparently this Shinjou is a formidable karate master.

[MSG$008FF5,48]
Judging by the way he's built, I can believe it.

[MSG$009032,44]
Shinjou "You'll find out if you take me on."

[MSG$0090AA,62]
So saying, Shinjou takes his position, hunching over slightly.

[MSG$0090ED,55]
He holds his elbows against his side, his arms relaxed.

[MSG$009129,55]
It's not a text-book position; it's for streetfighting.

[MSG$0091BE,48]
In contrast, Imari assumes a text-book position.

[MSG$0091F3,115]
She holds her right arm against her side, her left arm bent at a right-angle so it's perpendicular to her opponent.

[MSG$009273,60]
Karate and shorinji kempo are two totally different animals.

[MSG$0092BC,56]
In karate, you use force; you attack from top to bottom.

[MSG$0092F9,71]
You utilize your body weight in karate, so you can wreak maximum havoc.

[MSG$00934D,97]
Shorinji, on the other hand, involves using your whole body to thrust upward, from bottom to top.

[MSG$0093B3,86]
You go from bottom to top so you can be sure to hit your opponent's vulnerable points.

[MSG$00940E,88]
In this way, even someone without a lot of physical strength can do some serious damage.

[MSG$009473,83]
In shorinji, there are more moves where you attack after first receiving an attack.

[MSG$0094CB,75]
It's effective so long as there's no real discrepancy in height and weight;

[MSG$00951B,77]
but since Shinjou's so much bigger than her, Imari's at a clear disadvantage.

[MSG$009575,57]
This isn't going to be another scuffle with an amateur...

[MSG$0095BB,96]
Shinjou "Half-assed kempo, huh? You think you can take me out with sneakyass tactics like that?"

[MSG$009635,32]
Imari "You're really confident."

[MSG$00966F,94]
Shinjou "I have nothing against you, but I do have an image to maintain. Don't hate me, okay?"

[MSG$0096E7,80]
Imari "I wouldn't slack off just because I'm a girl...it's for your own safety!"

[MSG$009751,47]
Imari waits for Shinjou to make the first move.

[MSG$009785,86]
She's sticking to the book...make him make the first move, then switch to attack mode.

[MSG$0097E8,93]
Shinjou lets out a breath, then releases one of his log-like legs towards Imari's frail body.

[MSG$009852,32]
The kick slices through the air.

[MSG$00987F,36]
Imari jumps to the side to avoid it.

[MSG$0098A8,79]
As if he'd been anticipating that move, Shinjou throws a fist in her direction.

[MSG$009904,56]
Imari barely manages to dodge the blow by twisting away.

[MSG$009941,81]
With her left hand she grabs the fist that ends up in the space she just vacated;

[MSG$009997,50]
puts up her right arm and gets ready to throw him.

[MSG$0099D6,110]
To create an opportunity to make the throw, Imari starts to press against Shinjou's chest. But at that moment,

[MSG$009A49,55]
Shinjou brings up his right knee, in Imari's direction.

[MSG$009A8D,10]
Imari "!!"

[MSG$009AB1,82]
Seeing this, Imari lets go of Shinjou's hand, and blocks his knee in front of her.

[MSG$009B08,48]
Imari's body is rocked from the shock of impact.

[MSG$009B45,15]
Shinjou sneers.

[MSG$009B59,55]
Imari is right in front of Shinjou, totally vulnerable.

[MSG$009B9D,72]
In that instant, Shinjou unleashes a ferocious kick with his right foot.

[MSG$009BF2,25]
She has no time to dodge.

[MSG$009C10,77]
Imari instantly bends her left arm and left leg, to guard against the attack.

[MSG$009C62,31]
She's going to try to block it.

[MSG$009D27,6]
Whack!

[MSG$009D3A,59]
There's a huge thud, and Imari's body is bent over sharply.

[MSG$009D82,117]
Shinjou's kick is so brutal that it's able to breach Imari's guard. Imari might've thought she was totally protected,

[MSG$009DFC,73]
but in reality she'd done nothing more than to cushion the blow slightly.

[MSG$009E52,13]
Imari "Augh!"

[MSG$009E79,30]
Imari's face contorts in pain.

[MSG$009E9C,73]
If she hadn't had her guard up, she could've easily broken a bone or two.

[MSG$009EF2,60]
Imari is wobbling on her feet, but she maintains her stance.

[MSG$009F33,62]
Her eyes are unfocused. She has my respect for not collapsing.

[MSG$009F7E,26]
Shinjou "We're done here."

[MSG$009FB2,100]
With these cold words, Shinjou pulls back his fist to strike her in her upper body, now unprotected.

[MSG$00A0B8,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00A0CB,51]
He delivers a merciless blow to Imari's dazed face.

[MSG$00A103,62]
I can't believe he'd do that do a girl. What a cold bastard...

[MSG$00A14E,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00A1FC,24]
Body falls to the ground

[MSG$00A221,102]
Imari crumples to her knees. Then she falls onto the ground like a puppet whose strings have been cut.

[MSG$00A28C,41]
Blood is pouring from her nose and mouth.

[MSG$00A2C2,15]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$00A2EB,48]
I shout out her name as she falls to the ground.

[MSG$00A328,100]
But I don't have what it would take to save her. If she couldn't beat the guy, there's no way I can.

[MSG$00A391,44]
If I try to take him on, I could get killed.

[MSG$00A3CA,61]
Shinjou "I thought we'd have some fun, but that was nothing!"

[MSG$00A421,38]
Inoue "Gotta hand it to you, Shinjou."

[MSG$00A461,71]
Shinjou "This is the girl who beat you guys up? You oughta be ashamed."

[MSG$00A4C2,51]
Inoue "Sorry. To put you through all this trouble."

[MSG$00A50F,35]
Inoue "What should we do with her?"

[MSG$00A54C,40]
Shinjou "Do whatever you want with her."

[MSG$00A58E,38]
So saying, Shinjou leaves the rooftop.

[MSG$00A5C1,59]
Inoue "Okay...you really had your way with us, didn't you?"

[MSG$00A616,93]
Inoue "I bet you were enjoying yourself. So in return, you'd better make us enjoy ourselves!"

[MSG$00A68D,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00A6B5,50]
Imari might be unconscious; all she does is groan.

[MSG$00A6F4,47]
Inoue "Huh! What happened to all your bluster?"

[MSG$00A73D,90]
Inoue "We need you to be at full strength now. It's too soon for you to be all wiped out."

[MSG$00A7B1,28]
Inoue "Okay, take her away."

[MSG$00A7E7,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00A80F,34]
The guys behind him pick up Imari.

[MSG$00A8DD,17]
Minase "Stop it."

[MSG$00A908,34]
I call out to them, still in pain.

[MSG$00A937,49]
Inoue "Hey, that's right, forgot about you, huh?"

[MSG$00A982,66]
Inoue comes over to me like he's suddenly remembered my existence.

[MSG$00A9D1,102]
Inoue "You're the one we called out in the first place, right? But never mind, we'll let this one go."

[MSG$00AA51,45]
Minase "But she has nothing to do with it..."

[MSG$00AA98,80]
Inoue "You think we're going to let her get away with humiliating us like this?"

[MSG$00AB02,48]
Inoue "We've got to make her pay with her body."

[MSG$00AB4C,93]
Inoue "It really hurts where she kicked me. She has to massage me there or I won't be able to

[MSG$00ABAE,17]
|stand the pain."

[MSG$00ABD9,119]
Inoue "But hey, we're going to let you go free this time. You've got her to thank. Well, we didn't really care too much

[MSG$00AC55,33]
|about you in the first place..."

[MSG$00AC90,80]
Inoue "So anyway, that's the deal. We're borrowing your girlfriend for a while."

[MSG$00ACFA,78]
Inoue "Don't worry, we'll be sure to teach her all about grownup intercourse!"

[MSG$00AD62,62]
With that, Inoue and the others leave, taking Imari with them.

[MSG$00ADA5,47]
Imari's still dazed as the thugs drag her away.

[MSG$00AE05,12]
Door opening

[MSG$00AE1E,15]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$00AE47,51]
I'm standing all alone on the roof, in my own daze.

[MSG$00AE87,35]
I'm still aching in several places.

[MSG$00AEAF,62]
But that doesn't mean I can just wait around until I'm better.

[MSG$00AEFA,104]
It won't do any good to tell the professors...the faculty doesn't stand a chance against Shinjou either.

[MSG$00AF67,37]
I've got to do something on my own...

[MSG$00AF99,59]
And if I don't hurry, something bad will happen to Imari...

[MSG$00AFE1,66]
I try to endure the pain as I get up, and wobble over to the door.

[MSG$00B030,20]
April 24 - Classroom

[MSG$00B11C,49]
Minase "Saeki! Give me back that book right now!"

[MSG$00B167,63]
Saeki "Hold on, will you? I'll return it when school lets out."

[MSG$00B1C0,68]
Minase "Don't gimme that. Just hand it over now. That was the deal!"

[MSG$00B21E,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$00B243,24]
Saeki 'All right, then."

[MSG$00B275,92]
Saeki starts rummaging around in her bag, then takes out the book, wrapped in a white cloth.

[MSG$00B2DE,15]
Saeki "Here..."

[MSG$00B307,36]
Minase "As long as I've got this..."

[MSG$00B345,53]
I snatch it away from Saeki and rush out of the room.

[MSG$00B387,25]
April 24 - Imari Captured

[MSG$00B41F,42]
Minase "Where the hell did they take her?"

[MSG$00B463,67]
I run down the hall, trying to figure out where they could've gone.

[MSG$00B4B3,42]
Where would they most likely to have gone?

[MSG$00B4E2,85]
I've often seen them behind the school, but there's no place for them to hide a girl.

[MSG$00B544,57]
Even so, it's unlikely that they left the school grounds.

[MSG$00B582,71]
They couldn't just drag Imari around, it would be too much of a burden.

[MSG$00B5D6,47]
My best bet is probably the gym storage room...

[MSG$00B60A,93]
Once they're inside nobody will know they're in there. It's ideal for what they have in mind.

[MSG$00B674,83]
Clutching the cloth-wrapped book in my arms, I run faster towards the storage room.

[MSG$00B6D4,12]
Door opening

[MSG$00B71F,15]
Takashiro "Oh!"

[MSG$00B748,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00B808,5]
Slam!

[MSG$00B81A,17]
Takashiro "Augh!"

[MSG$00B869,6]
Crash!

[MSG$00B87C,82]
Takashiro suddenly emerges from a classroom, and I can't avoid colliding with her.

[MSG$00B8DB,71]
We both fall to the floor. She drops her art books and attendance book.

[MSG$00B927,59]
At the same time, I lose my grip on the cloth-wrapped book.

[MSG$00B96F,19]
Takashiro "Ouch..."

[MSG$00B99C,43]
She gets up unsteadily, rubbing her behind.

[MSG$00BA06,52]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. Are you all right?"

[MSG$00BA54,57]
Minase "Ouch! You shouldn't have come out so suddenly..."

[MSG$00BAA7,38]
I get up, too, rubbing my bruised hip.

[MSG$00BAD2,63]
My body is screaming in pain. First the beating and now this...

[MSG$00BB1E,95]
Takashiro "No, you shouldn't have been running in the halls. Didn't they teach you that back in

[MSG$00BB82,14]
|high school?"

[MSG$00BBAA,83]
So saying, Takashiro starts picking up the chalk that's scattered across the floor.

[MSG$00BC02,33]
It's all in pieces from the fall.

[MSG$00BC30,61]
Takashiro "Oh, my...I'm going to have to get some new chalk."

[MSG$00BC87,52]
I hastily reach for the book I dropped on the floor.

[MSG$00BCC8,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00BCEF,34]
I look over at the book and stare.

[MSG$00BD16,44]
Takashiro looks over, too, ready to help me.

[MSG$00BD4F,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$00BD7A,57]
She sees the cover of the book, now exposed, and freezes.

[MSG$00BDC0,53]
The white cloth has come off, baring the book inside.

[MSG$00BE02,31]
But it's not the Book of Magic.

[MSG$00BE26,43]
No way in hell is that the Book of Magic...

[MSG$00BE5E,25]
Girl "What's that? Jeez!"

[MSG$00BE92,75]
Several girls pass by and see what's on the floor. Their comments are cold.

[MSG$00BEEA,92]
Instead of the Book of Magic, the white cloth had been wrapped around uncensored porn books.

[MSG$00BF4B,52]
There's everything from S&M to animal fornication...

[MSG$00BF8C,84]
Some of them are open, and you can see women with huge boobs in the midst of a dump.

[MSG$00BFE5,40]
Of course, it's not censored in any way.

[MSG$00C01A,10]
Holy crap!

[MSG$00C031,50]
I stand there looking down at the books in a daze.

[MSG$00C070,49]
Takashiro "Minase...you're a maniac, aren't you?"

[MSG$00C0BB,106]
Takashiro "I can't tell you not to read those things, but I don't approve of you bringing them to school."

[MSG$00C13F,41]
Takashiro tells me this with a wry smile.

[MSG$00C175,7]
Jeez...

[MSG$00C189,65]
I'm so confused that I can't even get a grip on what's happening.

[MSG$00C1D7,72]
Okay, so I lent the Book of Magic to Saeki. Then I got her to return it.

[MSG$00C224,25]
And this is what I got...

[MSG$00C24A,54]
There's no way this is my fault. It's got to be Saeki.

[MSG$00C28D,46]
There's also no way that Saeki made a mistake.

[MSG$00C2C0,78]
Even if she did put in the wrong book, she wouldn't use these particular ones.

[MSG$00C31B,18]
Saeki set me up...

[MSG$00C332,69]
That bitch...she never had any intention of returning the book to me.

[MSG$00C384,22]
Minase "That bitch..."

[MSG$00C3B4,55]
But I don't have time for this. I have no time to lose!

[MSG$00C3F0,58]
I've got to do something about Imari before anything else.

[MSG$00C437,108]
If Saeki is indeed behind this, she would've known I'd find out. She probably left the classroom long ago...

[MSG$00C4B0,59]
It's Saeki, after all. She's never gonna give up that book.

[MSG$00C4F0,71]
I can't depend on the book anymore. I've got to save Imari on my own...

[MSG$00C544,17]
Takashiro "Here."

[MSG$00C570,85]
Takashiro gathers up the porn books, wraps them up in the cloth and hands them to me.

[MSG$00C5D2,22]
Maybe she can help me.

[MSG$00C5ED,50]
She did say she'd help me if something happened...

[MSG$00C62C,45]
I'm grasping at straws, but I have no choice.

[MSG$00C666,41]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro, I need your help!"

[MSG$00C6A9,35]
Takashiro "What? What do you mean?"

[MSG$00C6E6,50]
Minase "Inoue and his thugs dragged Imari away..."

[MSG$00C732,54]
Takashiro "They took Imari? Inoue, that troublemaker?"

[MSG$00C782,111]
Minase "That's right. She's in danger. Those jerks took her away so they could do something terrible to her..."

[MSG$00C80B,56]
I give her the short version, hoping she'll help me out.

[MSG$00C850,58]
Takashiro "All right, I think I understand what happened."

[MSG$00C8A4,63]
Takashiro "Leave it to me. I'll teach those hoodlums a lesson."

[MSG$00C8FD,45]
She thumps herself on the chest for emphasis.

[MSG$00C92F,104]
Other professors would probably opt to look the other way, but apparently she's not like other teachers.

[MSG$00C9A4,115]
Still, Inoue and his gang aren't the kind of guys who can be stopped by a mere teacher. I don't know if Takashiro's

[MSG$00CA1C,71]
|aware of this or not, but I have no choice but to put my faith in her.

[MSG$00CA70,31]
Takashiro "So, where are they?"

[MSG$00CAA9,49]
Minase "Probably in the storage room in the gym."

[MSG$00CAF4,56]
Takashiro "Then we'd better hurry before it's too late."

[MSG$00CB46,45]
So saying, she quickly heads towards the gym.

[MSG$00CB78,15]
I follow her...

[MSG$00CC10,32]
Takashiro and I enter the gym...

[MSG$00CC3D,61]
Afternoon classes have already started, but the gym is empty.

[MSG$00CC7F,94]
It looks like there aren't going to be any P.E. classes today. Perfect for Inoue and his gang.

[MSG$00CCEA,23]
Takashiro "This is it?"

[MSG$00CD1B,46]
We look at the steel door to the storage room.

[MSG$00CD4E,38]
We can hear voices coming from inside.

[MSG$00CD79,47]
No question, Inoue and his gang are in there...

[MSG$00CDB5,36]
Takashiro "Are you ready? Let's go."

[MSG$00CDF3,15]
I nod silently.

[MSG$00CEAE,12]
Door opening

[MSG$00CEC7,53]
Inoue "Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$00CF16,65]
As soon as the steel door opens, we can hear Inoue's loud shriek.

[MSG$00CF64,62]
Just as I'd thought, Inoue and the others are loitering there.

[MSG$00CFA7,34]
And they're standing around Imari.

[MSG$00D052,15]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$00D07B,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00D0A3,28]
Imari gives me a blank look.

[MSG$00D0CC,42]
Apparently nothing's been done to her yet.

[MSG$00D103,76]
But they've half-undressed her, and you can see the white skin of her chest.

[MSG$00D154,63]
Her legs are spread wide open, with her underwear in full view.

[MSG$00D1A0,28]
But something's not right...

[MSG$00D1C1,86]
Imari's eyes are unfocused. and she doesn't seem to be able to hear what we're saying.

[MSG$00D224,87]
Inoue "You again? I thought you'd learned your lesson. First this girl has to save you,

[MSG$00D280,64]
and now it's this woman professor? And you call yourself a man?"

[MSG$00D2DA,87]
I'll just let him say whatever he wants. The only important thing now is to save Imari.

[MSG$00D33E,34]
Minase "What did you do to Imari?"

[MSG$00D37A,56]
Inoue "We just smoked up together, so we can feel good."

[MSG$00D3CD,66]
Inoue gives us a glimpse of the cigarette-like object in his hand.

[MSG$00D41C,28]
Inoue "You want a drag too?"

[MSG$00D452,70]
He puts it to his lips, inhales deeply, then exhales in our direction.

[MSG$00D49D,62]
The smoke envelopes us, and I can smell its deep, sweet scent.

[MSG$00D4E8,91]
This isn't your normal cigarette...I know a few people on campus who have smokes like these

[MSG$00D548,7]
|too...

[MSG$00D55C,96]
Takashiro "I can't believe you'd smoke that here! You'll be expelled. I hope you're prepared..."

[MSG$00D5D6,51]
Inoue "I'd like to see you try to get me expelled."

[MSG$00D623,79]
With that, Inoue takes another hit, and exhales the smoke through his nostrils.

[MSG$00D67F,105]
Inoue knows. Even if a professor were to squeal on him, it would be nothing for him to get it covered up.

[MSG$00D6ED,48]
And surely Takashiro knows that only too well...

[MSG$00D72A,45]
Takashiro "You let Ms. Imari go this minute!"

[MSG$00D771,65]
Inoue "Well, if you take her place, I'll be happy to let her go."

[MSG$00D7CC,50]
Inoue "I enjoy doing older women once in a while."

[MSG$00D818,25]
Takashiro "How dare you!"

[MSG$00D84B,73]
Inoue "Don't get mad, teach. Anyway, this bitch seems to like the stuff."

[MSG$00D8AE,27]
He leers when he says this.

[MSG$00D8D6,20]
Takashiro "Stop it!"

[MSG$00D904,72]
Ignoring her, Inoue brings the joint closer and closer to Imari's mouth.

[MSG$00D9E2,57]
Imari tries to fight it, but he forces it into her mouth.

[MSG$00DA20,29]
Next he pinches Imari's nose.

[MSG$00DA4A,86]
Unable to breathe, Imari begins to struggle. Finally she's forces to inhale the smoke.

[MSG$00DAAD,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00DAD5,17]
Imari "(gagging)"

[MSG$00DB00,51]
Imari begins to choke as her lungs fill with smoke.

[MSG$00DB40,20]
Inoue "(snickering)"

[MSG$00DB6E,21]
Minase "Goddamn you!"

[MSG$00DB9D,22]
I'm shaking with rage.

[MSG$00DBC0,44]
Inoue "What is it, Minase? Are you mad? Ha!"

[MSG$00DC06,81]
Inoue "If you got a problem with this, just bring it. I'll take you on any time."

[MSG$00DC71,79]
Sneering, Inoue tries to bait me. But I can't do anything but ball up my fists.

[MSG$00DCCD,48]
Takashiro "Don't worry, I'll take care of this."

[MSG$00DD17,47]
Takashiro speaks to me as I tremble with anger.

[MSG$00DD53,27]
Imari "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$00DD88,72]
Imari's eyes look even more drowsy than before. She's breathing heavily.

[MSG$00DDDD,34]
Inoue "Is she getting a buzz now?"

[MSG$00DE92,84]
With that, Inoue sticks his hand between Imari's legs, spread wide open. His fingers

[MSG$00DEEB,44]
|trace her crevice, rubbing her up and down.

[MSG$00DF24,86]
The two thugs behind him watch this, leering as they begin to massage Imari's breasts.

[MSG$00DF87,11]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$00DF9F,80]
Takashiro "Stop that right now! What do you think you're doing, in front of us?"

[MSG$00E009,40]
Inoue "Ha! You got a problem with this?"

[MSG$00E04B,88]
Inoue "Want me to do the same to you, Prof? Anyway, this little bitch seems to like it."

[MSG$00E0BD,27]
Imari "Mmm...mmm...ahhh..."

[MSG$00E0F2,85]
Imari is writhing with a look of confusion on her face as Inoue's fingers continue to

[MSG$00E14C,15]
|stimulate her.

[MSG$00E168,95]
It might be because she's been drugged, but Imari's getting aroused even in the state she's in.

[MSG$00E1CC,47]
There's definitely a mature woman inside her...

[MSG$00E208,37]
Inoue "Just look. She's getting off!"

[MSG$00E247,78]
Inoue gets carried away and shoves his fingers inside. He begins to rub her up

[MSG$00E29A,83]
|in the sensitive area of her vulva, which is discernible even through her panties.

[MSG$00E2FA,25]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..ahhhh!"

[MSG$00E32D,15]
|her panties...

[MSG$00E341,82]
At last Inoue removes his hand from between Imari's legs. There's a small stain on

[MSG$00E398,15]
|her panties...

[MSG$00E3B4,47]
Inoue starts sniffing the juice on his fingers.

[MSG$00E3F0,35]
Inoue "What a nasty smell. Hahaha!"

[MSG$00E42D,43]
Takashiro "You'd better stop it right now!"

[MSG$00E472,51]
Takashiro "If you go any further, you'll be sorry!"

[MSG$00E4BF,60]
Inoue "Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it, huh, Prof?"

[MSG$00E515,96]
Inoue "You're nothing but an art professor...Better not get out of line or I'll make you sorry!"

[MSG$00E62E,48]
Takashiro "You're not going to listen, are you?"

[MSG$00E678,69]
Takashiro "Well, in that case I'll have to resort to other measures."

[MSG$00E6D7,49]
With that, Takashiro puts her hand in her pocket.

[MSG$00E715,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$00E72D,70]
I glance over at Takashiro's pocket. I can see her white hand gripping

[MSG$00E778,24]
|some kind of black box.

[MSG$00E795,23]
What's she going to do?

[MSG$00E7B9,49]
Takashiro advances, first one step, then another.

[MSG$00E7F7,54]
Inoue "Hey, let's be gentle with the professor, guys."

[MSG$00E8AB,61]
So saying, one of the thugs advances with a leer on his face.

[MSG$00E8ED,103]
He puts his hand to his hip and withdraws a retractable police baton from a pouch attached to his belt.

[MSG$00E961,5]
Snap!

[MSG$00E973,99]
He flings it outward, and the baton snaps out with a ringing sound. Open, it's three times as long.

[MSG$00E9E3,71]
Inoue "What are you gonna do now, teach? Why don't we call your bluff?"

[MSG$00EA44,16]
Inoue "Get her!"

[MSG$00EA6E,45]
At Inoue's signal, the thug raises the baton.

[MSG$00EAA8,5]
Whip!

[MSG$00EABA,62]
The metal stick is brought down hard, slicing through the air.

[MSG$00EB93,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00EC4F,12]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$00EC99,48]
But it's the thug who ends up screaming in pain.

[MSG$00ECD6,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00ECFD,68]
The thug jumps away from Takashiro as if he's been repelled somehow.

[MSG$00ED4E,6]
Thump!

[MSG$00ED61,75]
All 4 of his limbs are rigid, and he rolls around on the floor, convulsing.

[MSG$00EDB1,35]
I can see the whites of his eyes...

[MSG$00EE5D,40]
Takashiro "Oh, did that sting too much?"

[MSG$00EE9F,67]
Takashiro addresses the thug on the floor with a mischievous smile.

[MSG$00EEEF,48]
There's a black, nondescript object in her hand.

[MSG$00EF24,89]
It's a stun gun...and judging by the state the thug's in, it must be pretty high-voltage.

[MSG$00F003,26]
Crackle, crackle, crackle!

[MSG$00F02A,110]
Takashiro snaps on the switch. There's a whirring sound, and a bluish light emanates from the tip of stun gun.

[MSG$00F0A5,43]
Takashiro "Who wants to get punished next?"

[MSG$00F0EA,83]
Inoue "What the hell! You're a professor, and you carry around a goddamn stun gun?"

[MSG$00F157,54]
Takashiro "A lady has to protect herself, you know..."

[MSG$00F1A7,13]
Inoue "Grrr!"

[MSG$00F1CE,52]
Inoue "Hey! Somebody shut this psycho professor up!"

[MSG$00F21C,44]
But no one has the courage to go near her...

[MSG$00F255,26]
Takashiro "What a wimp..."

[MSG$00F289,49]
Takashiro "Can't you take me on yourself, Inoue?"

[MSG$00F2D4,25]
Inoue "What did you say?"

[MSG$00F307,79]
Takashiro "What's it going to be? If you're not going to make a move, shall I?"

[MSG$00F370,42]
With that, Takashiro flicks on the switch.

[MSG$00F3A7,28]
Crackle, crackle, crackle...

[MSG$00F3D0,52]
Inoue trembles at the ominous sound of the stun gun.

[MSG$00F411,41]
Inoue "I...I've got a weak heart, see..."

[MSG$00F454,94]
Inoue stares at the bluish-white light as he makes this lame excuse, a weak smile on his face.

[MSG$00F4B7,29]
His legs are audibly shaking.

[MSG$00F580,42]
Takashiro "No one's going to make a move?"

[MSG$00F5C4,43]
Takashiro "Then I guess that means we win."

[MSG$00F609,76]
Takashiro "All right, Minase. Take Imari to the campus infirmary, will you?"

[MSG$00F66F,74]
Takashiro "I'm going to stay behind and teach these degenerates a lesson."

[MSG$00F6D3,85]
I nod my head, fix Imari's clothing, and carry her limp body out of the storage room.

[MSG$00F7B9,115]
Takashiro "Now then! You know what you have coming, don't you? I'm going to give you the punishment of your lives!"

[MSG$00F846,54]
I could hear these words from inside the storage room.

[MSG$00F89E,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00F8B1,14]
Thug A "Augh!"

[MSG$00F8EE,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00F901,14]
Thug B "Augh!"

[MSG$00F929,52]
Their shrieks of agony echo around the silent gym...

[MSG$00F9F1,53]
I hurry back to my classroom and rush toward my seat.

[MSG$00FA2B,63]
I open my bag, and take out the book, wrapped in a white cloth.

[MSG$00FA77,36]
Minase "As long as I've got this..."

[MSG$00FAB5,48]
Clutching the book, I leave the classroom again.

[MSG$00FAF2,25]
April 24 - Imari Captured

[MSG$00FB8A,42]
Minase "Where the hell did they take her?"

[MSG$00FBCE,67]
I run down the hall, trying to figure out where they could've gone.

[MSG$00FC1E,42]
Where would they most likely to have gone?

[MSG$00FC4D,85]
I've often seen them behind the school, but there's no place for them to hide a girl.

[MSG$00FCAF,57]
Even so, it's unlikely that they left the school grounds.

[MSG$00FCED,71]
They couldn't just drag Imari around, it would be too much of a burden.

[MSG$00FD41,47]
My best bet is probably the gym storage room...

[MSG$00FD75,93]
Once they're inside nobody will know they're in there. It's ideal for what they have in mind.

[MSG$00FDDF,83]
Clutching the cloth-wrapped book in my arms, I run faster towards the storage room.

[MSG$00FE37,14]
(Door opening)

[MSG$00FE84,15]
Takashiro "Oh!"

[MSG$00FEAD,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00FF6D,6]
Slam!!

[MSG$00FF80,17]
Takashiro "Augh!"

[MSG$00FFCF,6]
Crash!

[MSG$00FFE2,82]
Takashiro suddenly emerges from a classroom, and I can't avoid colliding into her.

[MSG$010041,71]
We both fall to the floor. She drops her art books and attendance book.

[MSG$01008D,59]
At the same time, I lose my grip on the cloth-wrapped book.

[MSG$0100D5,19]
Takashiro "Ouch..."

[MSG$010102,43]
She gets up unsteadily, rubbing her behind.

[MSG$01016C,52]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. Are you all right?"

[MSG$0101BA,57]
Minase "Ouch! You shouldn't have come out so suddenly..."

[MSG$01020D,38]
I get up, too, rubbing my bruised hip.

[MSG$010238,63]
My body is screaming in pain. First the beating and now this...

[MSG$010284,90]
Takashiro "No, you shouldn't have been running in the halls. Didn't they teach you that in

[MSG$0102E3,22]
|back in high school?"

[MSG$010313,83]
So saying, Takashiro starts picking up the chalk that's scattered across the floor.

[MSG$01036B,33]
It's all in pieces from the fall.

[MSG$010399,61]
Takashiro "Oh, my...I'm going to have to get some new chalk."

[MSG$0103F0,52]
I hastily reach for the book I dropped on the floor.

[MSG$010429,55]
I definitely don't want Takashiro to see what's inside.

[MSG$01046D,95]
Out of the corner of my eye, I watch Takashiro frantically picking up the broken bits of chalk,

[MSG$0104D1,61]
as I quickly scoop up the cloth-wrapped book a few feet away.

[MSG$01051B,86]
The cloth has come undone from the shock of the fall, and you can see the book inside.

[MSG$010576,58]
I quickly cover it up again with the cloth and pick it up.

[MSG$0105BD,46]
Takashiro "Well...finally picked them all up."

[MSG$010605,80]
Takashiro's finally done putting the chalk back into its box and looks up at me.

[MSG$010662,47]
Takashiro "Watch where you're going next time."

[MSG$0106AB,43]
Takashiro brushes the dust off her clothes.

[MSG$0106E3,51]
I don't have time for this. I have no time to lose!

[MSG$010723,41]
Minase "See you later. I'm in a hurry..."

[MSG$010766,70]
Takashiro "Excuse me, didn't I just tell you not to run in the halls?"

[MSG$0107C6,41]
Ignoring Takashiro, I race down the hall.

[MSG$010878,16]
I enter the gym.

[MSG$010895,61]
Afternoon classes have already started, but the gym is empty.

[MSG$0108D7,94]
It looks like there aren't going to be any P.E. classes today. Perfect for Inoue and his gang.

[MSG$010942,66]
Minase "I'll bet a million dollars Inoue and his gang are here..."

[MSG$01099E,70]
I'm convinced of this as I look at the steel door of the storage room.

[MSG$0109F1,39]
I can hear voices coming from inside...

[MSG$010A1D,22]
There's no question...

[MSG$010A40,52]
I slowly unwrap the cloth from the book in my hands.

[MSG$010A81,69]
Minase "I don't care if you're a god or a demon, just help me out..."

[MSG$010AE0,61]
Praying silently, I open the book and flip through the pages.

[MSG$010B2A,23]
I don't have much time.

[MSG$010B46,86]
It's got to have an instant effect. So there aren't a lot of spells I can choose from.

[MSG$010BA9,76]
Since I have neither the tools nor the time, I'll have to go with a charm...

[MSG$010BFA,42]
I already know how effective those can be.

[MSG$010C29,46]
I just hope it will work out this time, too...

[MSG$010C64,19]
Flip, flip, flip...

[MSG$010C84,82]
I flip through page after page of pentacle drawings, in search of the right spell.

[MSG$010CDB,92]
Needless to say, I'll be playing this one by ear, so I have no idea how powerful it will be.

[MSG$010D44,75]
I brush away such misgivings, and pick out one I think will be appropriate.

[MSG$010D94,81]
I take a pen from my uniform pocket, remove the cap and place it against my palm.

[MSG$010DF2,94]
Minase "The Lord is on my side, and on the day of his great anger he shall smite all kings..."

[MSG$010E6A,59]
I draw a pentacle on my left palm as I whisper these words.

[MSG$010EB2,90]
When I'm done drawing, I open and close my fist for confirmation. I used an oil-based pen,

[MSG$010F11,41]
so I'm sure it won't rub off that easily.

[MSG$010F47,28]
But I don't see any changes.

[MSG$010F70,35]
Minase "Is this really gonna work?"

[MSG$010FAD,95]
The pentacle of power...I have misgivings, but right now I have no choice but to believe in it.

[MSG$011011,52]
I've never had less confidence in an unseen power...

[MSG$011052,19]
Minase "All right."

[MSG$01107F,37]
|cold steel door of the storage room.

[MSG$0110A9,109]
I gather up my concentration by clenching my hand with the pentacle drawn on it once more, then reach for the

[MSG$01111B,37]
|cold steel door of the storage room.

[MSG$0111EC,14]
(Door opening)

[MSG$0111FF,53]
Inoue "Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$01124E,64]
As soon as the steel door opens, I can hear Inoue's loud shriek.

[MSG$01129B,62]
Just as I'd thought, Inoue and the others are loitering there.

[MSG$0112DE,34]
And they're standing around Imari.

[MSG$011389,15]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$0113B2,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$0113DA,28]
Imari gives me a blank look.

[MSG$011403,42]
Apparently nothing's been done to her yet.

[MSG$01143A,76]
But they've half-undressed her, and you can see the white skin of her chest.

[MSG$01148B,63]
Her legs are spread wide open, with her underwear in full view.

[MSG$0114D7,28]
But something's not right...

[MSG$0114F8,86]
Imari's eyes are unfocused. and she doesn't seem to be able to hear what we're saying.

[MSG$01155B,85]
Inoue "You again? Thought you'd learned your lesson. First this girl has to save you,

[MSG$0115B5,48]
and now it's this? And you call yourself a man?"

[MSG$0115FF,87]
I'll just let him say whatever he wants. The only important thing now is to save Imari.

[MSG$011663,34]
Minase "What did you do to Imari?"

[MSG$01169F,56]
Inoue "We just smoked up together, so we can feel good."

[MSG$0116F2,66]
Inoue gives me a glimpse of the cigarette-like object in his hand.

[MSG$011741,28]
Inoue "You want a drag too?"

[MSG$011777,69]
He puts it to his lips, inhales deeply, then exhales in my direction.

[MSG$0117C1,62]
The smoke envelopes us, and I can smell its deep, sweet scent.

[MSG$01180C,91]
This isn't your normal cigarette...I know a few people on campus who have smokes like these

[MSG$01186C,7]
|too...

[MSG$011878,36]
Minase "You let Imari go right now!"

[MSG$0118B6,66]
Inoue "Are you ordering me around? You watch your mouth, dipshit."

[MSG$011912,51]
Inoue "Anyway, this bitch seems to like the stuff."

[MSG$01195F,25]
He leers as he says this.

[MSG$011985,64]
Imari remains in a daze, looking around her with unfocused eyes.

[MSG$0119CA,61]
Inoue takes another hit, then takes the joint from his mouth.

[MSG$011A14,17]
Minase "Stop it!"

[MSG$011A3F,71]
Ignoring me, Inoue brings the joint closer and closer to Imari's mouth.

[MSG$011B1C,57]
Imari tries to fight it, but he forces it into her mouth.

[MSG$011B5A,29]
Next he pinches Imari's nose.

[MSG$011B84,86]
Unable to breathe, Imari begins to struggle. Finally she's forced to inhale the smoke.

[MSG$011BE7,14]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$011C0F,17]
Imari "(gagging)"

[MSG$011C3A,51]
Imari begins to choke as her lungs fill with smoke.

[MSG$011C7A,20]
Inoue "(snickering)"

[MSG$011CA8,21]
Minase "Goddamn you!"

[MSG$011CD7,22]
I'm shaking with rage.

[MSG$011CFA,44]
Inoue "What is it, Minase? Are you mad? Ha!"

[MSG$011D40,81]
Inoue "If you got a problem with this, just bring it. I'll take you on any time."

[MSG$011DAB,33]
Sneering, Inoue tries to bait me.

[MSG$011DD9,16]
Minase "Grrr..."

[MSG$011E03,18]
I clench my fists.

[MSG$011E1A,50]
Can I really take out these jerks with this spell?

[MSG$011E51,62]
If it doesn't work, then both Imari and I will be in for it...

[MSG$011E9C,27]
Imari "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$011ED1,72]
Imari's eyes look even more drowsy than before. She's breathing heavily.

[MSG$011F26,34]
Inoue "Is she getting a buzz now?"

[MSG$011FDB,84]
With that, Inoue sticks his hand between Imari's legs, spread wide open. His fingers

[MSG$012034,44]
|trace her crevice, rubbing her up and down.

[MSG$01206D,86]
The two thugs behind him watch this, leering as they begin to massage Imari's breasts.

[MSG$0120D0,29]
Minase "What are you doing?!"

[MSG$0120FA,40]
Inoue "Ha! You got a problem with this?"

[MSG$01213C,51]
Inoue "Anyway, this little bitch seems to like it."

[MSG$012189,27]
Imari "Mmm...mmm...ahhh..."

[MSG$0121BE,85]
Imari is writhing with a look of confusion on her face as Inoue's fingers continue to

[MSG$012218,15]
|stimulate her.

[MSG$012234,95]
It might be because she's been drugged, but Imari's getting aroused even in the state she's in.

[MSG$012298,47]
There's definitely a mature woman inside her...

[MSG$0122D4,37]
Inoue "Just look. She's getting off!"

[MSG$012313,78]
Inoue gets carried away and shoves his fingers inside. He begins to rub her up

[MSG$012366,83]
|in the sensitive area of her vulva, which is discernible even through her panties.

[MSG$0123C6,25]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..ahhhh!"

[MSG$0123F9,15]
|her panties...

[MSG$01240D,82]
At last Inoue removes his hand from between Imari's legs. There's a small stain on

[MSG$012464,15]
|her panties...

[MSG$012480,47]
Inoue starts sniffing the juice on his fingers.

[MSG$0124BC,35]
Inoue "What a nasty smell. Hahaha!"

[MSG$0124F9,57]
Inoue "I guess she likes me a lot better than you, wuss!"

[MSG$01254C,27]
Minase "Stop it right now!"

[MSG$012581,70]
I can't take it anymore. I've got to believe in the power of my spell.

[MSG$0125D4,49]
Inoue "Oooh, I'm so scared. Calm down, will you?"

[MSG$01261F,89]
Inoue "Don't worry, I'll let you screw her after I'm done. Until then, why don't you just

[MSG$01267D,45]
|sit back and jerk off while you're waiting?"

[MSG$0126C4,48]
Minase "If you go any farther, you'll be sorry!"

[MSG$01270E,75]
Inoue "Oh, yeah? And just what do you think you're gonna do about it, huh?"

[MSG$012773,101]
Inoue "There's only one of you, shithead. Do you want me to make you crawl all over the floor again?"

[MSG$0127F2,69]
Minase "Don't think it's going to turn out the same way this time..."

[MSG$012851,81]
I say this, praying inwardly with everything I have that my words will come true.

[MSG$0128AF,22]
Inoue "Interesting..."

[MSG$0128DF,35]
Inoue starts cracking his knuckles.

[MSG$0129BC,54]
Inoue "Hey, somebody beat the crap out of this loser."

[MSG$012A0C,81]
At these words, one of the thugs comes towards me slowly with a leer on his face.

[MSG$012A62,103]
He puts his hand to his hip and withdraws a retractable police baton from a pouch attached to his belt.

[MSG$012AD6,5]
Snap!

[MSG$012AE8,99]
He flings it outward, and the baton snaps out with a ringing sound. Open, it's three times as long.

[MSG$012B58,72]
Inoue "What are you gonna do now, Minase? Why don't we call your bluff?"

[MSG$012BBA,16]
Inoue "Get him!"

[MSG$012BE4,45]
At Inoue's signal, the thug raises the baton.

[MSG$012C1E,72]
Damn...if I get hit with that thing, I'm gonna break something for sure.

[MSG$012C73,5]
Whip!

[MSG$012C85,62]
The metal stick is brought down hard, slicing through the air.

[MSG$012CD0,65]
I close my eyes and wildly put up my left hand to protect myself.

[MSG$012D16,56]
Just as I think one of my bones is about to be broken...

[MSG$012DF4,5]
Whip!

[MSG$012E06,42]
With a sharp sound, it slams into my hand.

[MSG$012E3D,12]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$012E63,38]
But it's the thug who shrieks in pain.

[MSG$012EBA,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$012EE1,15]
Clang, clang...

[MSG$012EFD,57]
I open my eyes and the thug is gripping his hand in pain.

[MSG$012F3B,58]
The baton has fallen to the ground, where it rolls around.

[MSG$012F82,84]
My left hand doesn't hurt at all, even though that's where I got hit with the baton.

[MSG$012FDB,42]
I shake my left hand, but nothing's wrong.

[MSG$013012,32]
Minase "Haha, I'm totally fine."

[MSG$01304C,32]
I stare at my hand in disbelief.

[MSG$0130AB,42]
Inoue "What the...what the hell happened?"

[MSG$0130EF,46]
Inoue's eyes are about to pop out of his head.

[MSG$01312A,54]
The fact is, the baton did strike the palm of my hand.

[MSG$013165,57]
But not only didn't my hand break, it deflected the blow.

[MSG$0131A3,38]
So that's the power of the pentacle...

[MSG$0131D6,24]
Minase "It's working..."

[MSG$013208,40]
I'm convinced now. The spell is working.

[MSG$013235,44]
Now I have nothing to fear from these jerks.

[MSG$01326E,60]
Minase "You had a lot of nerve, roughing me up like that..."

[MSG$0132C4,43]
I walk towards Inoue, cracking my knuckles.

[MSG$0132F4,32]
Our fortunes have been reversed.

[MSG$013321,57]
Inoue "That was just a fluke. Hey, somebody shut him up!"

[MSG$013374,26]
Minase "Just bring it on."

[MSG$0133A8,54]
I smile confidently, and bait them by waving my hands.

[MSG$0133E3,44]
When they see me do this, they both jump me.

[MSG$013495,21]
Minase "Minase Kick!"

[MSG$0134D8,4]
Pow!

[MSG$0134E9,12]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$01350F,21]
Minase "Minase Chop!"

[MSG$013553,8]
Crack...

[MSG$013568,12]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$01358E,86]
I adopt Imari's strategy, taking them on and tossing them to the side over and over...

[MSG$0135F1,74]
Even my sloppiest moves are direct hits. And thanks to their lethal force,

[MSG$013640,50]
I manage to drop them all to the floor one by one.

[MSG$01371C,22]
Inoue "No...no way..."

[MSG$01374C,71]
I step all over the losers on the floor as I noisily dust off my hands.

[MSG$0137A0,41]
Minase "Okay...you're the only one left."

[MSG$0137E3,24]
I stare at Inoue coldly.

[MSG$013800,97]
Inoue has been watching all this, and now he smiles at me as though he's about to piss his pants.

[MSG$01386E,17]
Inoue "Hahaha..."

[MSG$013899,99]
Inoue "We're...we're really sorry about what we did to you, Minase. Come on, let's be friends now."

[MSG$013916,16]
Minase "No way."

[MSG$013940,58]
Inoue "Hey, don't be like that. We're buddies, aren't we?"

[MSG$013994,43]
Inoue "Come on...listen, I'll do anything!"

[MSG$0139D9,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0139F2,36]
I stare at this loser, my eyes cold.

[MSG$013A1B,78]
He'll do anything, huh? In that case, why don't I make him pay for everything?

[MSG$013A9E,44]
Minase "You said you'll do anything, right?"

[MSG$013AE4,74]
Inoue "Sure, sure, that's right. Anything you say. You want money? Women?"

[MSG$013B48,46]
Minase "Go run through the school butt-naked."

[MSG$013B90,27]
I say this in a cold voice.

[MSG$013BB8,13]
Inoue "What?"

[MSG$013BDF,45]
Inoue "You think I'd do something like that?"

[MSG$013C26,46]
Minase "Oh, you don't want to? That's okay..."

[MSG$013C6E,65]
Minase "But I'm gonna have to break a few of your bones, then..."

[MSG$013CC9,58]
Hearing this, the blood slowly drains out of Inoue's face.

[MSG$013D10,47]
Inoue "Okay, I'll do it! Please, let me do it!"

[MSG$013D59,35]
Minase "You don't want to, though."

[MSG$013D96,94]
Inoue "That's not true. I was just thinking it would be great to run around the school naked!"

[MSG$013E0E,31]
Nobody would ever think that...

[MSG$013E3A,38]
Minase "Okay, then, why don't you go?"

[MSG$013E9F,116]
Hearing my cold words, Inoue gives up and sheds his clothes. When he's stark naked, he runs out of the storage room.

[MSG$013F18,51]
His huge prick dangles and bobs between his legs...

[MSG$013F58,14]
Inoue "Ahhhh!"

[MSG$013F80,49]
With a loud cry, Inoue races inside the building.

[MSG$013FBE,36]
Voice "Augh! What's wrong with you?"

[MSG$013FFC,38]
Guy "Shit! Don't come near me, freak!"

[MSG$01403C,87]
After Inoue disappears inside, I can hear shrieks and yelps from all over the building.

[MSG$014098,55]
The sight of Inoue's naked body is causing an uproar...

[MSG$0140EF,44]
Minase "You said you'll do anything, right?"

[MSG$014135,74]
Inoue "Sure, sure, that's right. Anything you say. You want money? Women?"

[MSG$014199,81]
Minase "Okay, then, maybe I'll make you stand in front of the school gate naked."

[MSG$014204,27]
I say this in a cold voice.

[MSG$01422C,13]
Inoue "What?"

[MSG$014253,45]
Inoue "You think I'd do something like that?"

[MSG$01429A,46]
Minase "Oh, you don't want to? That's okay..."

[MSG$0142E2,65]
Minase "But I'm gonna have to break a few of your bones, then..."

[MSG$01433D,58]
Hearing this, the blood slowly drains out of Inoue's face.

[MSG$014384,47]
Inoue "Okay, I'll do it! Please, let me do it!"

[MSG$0143CD,35]
Minase "You don't want to, though."

[MSG$01440A,23]
Inoue "That's not true.

[MSG$014426,102]
I was just thinking it would be great if I could stand in front of the school gate and expose myself."

[MSG$0144A6,31]
Nobody would ever think that...

[MSG$0144D2,93]
Minase "In that case, while you're at it, why don't you jerk off, too? In front of everyone?"

[MSG$014549,30]
Inoue "You...you little shit!"

[MSG$014581,47]
Minase "Oh, I see...you don't want to do it..."

[MSG$0145CA,40]
Inoue freezes when he sees my cold gaze.

[MSG$0145FF,80]
Inoue "Oh, come on, I was just kidding! I'll jerk off like there's no tomorrow!"

[MSG$014669,38]
Minase "Okay, then, why don't you go?"

[MSG$0146CD,116]
Hearing my cold words, Inoue gives up and sheds his clothes. When he's stark naked, he runs out of the storage room.

[MSG$014746,51]
His huge prick dangles and bobs between his legs...

[MSG$014786,13]
Inoue "Ahhh!"

[MSG$0147AD,58]
I can hear Inoue's brave cry from the storage room window.

[MSG$0147F4,44]
Voice "Augh! What does he think he's doing?"

[MSG$01483B,47]
Voice "Can you believe the size of that thing?"

[MSG$014885,39]
Voice "Gross! Something just came out!"

[MSG$0148C7,114]
After Inoue leaves, I hear shrieks and yelps from outside. The sight of Inoue's naked body is causing an uproar...

[MSG$014946,22]
Minase "What a moron."

[MSG$014977,44]
With that, I walk towards Imari's limp body.

[MSG$0149A8,61]
Then I fix her clothes and carry her out of the storage room.

[MSG$0149F2,78]
Imari ended up like this because she tried to save me. So saving her in return

[MSG$014A45,24]
|is my responsibility...

[MSG$014A6A,28]
April 24 - Medical Treatment

[MSG$014B6B,12]
Door opening

[MSG$014B84,74]
I carry the limp Imari into the infirmary, supporting her by the shoulder.

[MSG$014BDB,22]
Click, click, click...

[MSG$014BFE,67]
Inside the infirmary, Dr. Kitami is at her desk typing on a laptop.

[MSG$014C80,14]
Kitami "Well!"

[MSG$014CA8,57]
She notices us, quickly closes her laptop and walks over.

[MSG$014CE6,101]
She's got that sexy vibe as usual as she looks us over. It feels like she's licking us with her gaze.

[MSG$014D58,30]
Kitami "What happened to you?"

[MSG$014D90,32]
Minase "Fell down the stairs..."

[MSG$014DCA,53]
I hand Imari over to her, giving her a random excuse.

[MSG$014E0C,21]
Kitami "Both of you?"

[MSG$014E3B,69]
Kitami "Really, now...Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Let me treat you."

[MSG$014F2B,9]
.........

[MSG$014FBD,16]
Minase "Ow! Ow!"

[MSG$014FE7,86]
Kitami "Come on, sit still. I can't disinfect the wound if you move around like that."

[MSG$015057,27]
I let her disinfect my cut.

[MSG$015077,37]
It's the scrape I got up on the roof.

[MSG$0150A9,83]
Imari is in bed. I guess she's still in a daze, because as soon as she hits the bed

[MSG$015101,18]
|she falls asleep.

[MSG$015120,71]
It'll probably be better to let her rest until she gets back to normal.

[MSG$015174,71]
Kitami "But how come she's in worse shape than you, when you're a guy?"

[MSG$0151D5,31]
Kitami "Did she fight for you?"

[MSG$01520F,61]
She talks to me as she tends to my wounds. I grimace in pain.

[MSG$015259,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$015280,44]
Kitami "You can see a lot from this window."

[MSG$0152C6,33]
Kitami glances toward the window.

[MSG$0152F4,69]
True, she probably had a good view of the rooftop from this window...

[MSG$01533E,26]
So she knows everything...

[MSG$015365,72]
Minase "I was getting beaten up, and Imari jumped in to try to save me."

[MSG$0153C7,68]
I confess to Kitami, seeing that there's no sense in covering it up.

[MSG$015418,55]
Kitami "So the knight got rescued by the princess, eh?"

[MSG$015469,52]
Kitami "And that's why you both ended up like this?"

[MSG$0154B7,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0154D0,73]
Kitami "I see...so the magician isn't really what he's cracked up to be."

[MSG$015533,21]
Minase "Magician...?"

[MSG$015562,88]
Kitami "Everyone's talking about your magic spells. I hear they're extremely effective?"

[MSG$0155D4,89]
Delinquent students are always hanging out in the infirmary, she must've heard the rumors

[MSG$015632,13]
|from them...

[MSG$01564C,80]
Kitami "Just like those students from 12 years ago. They were magicians, too..."

[MSG$0156B6,66]
Minase "You mean you know about that? What happened 12 years ago?"

[MSG$015712,61]
Kitami "Yes, of course I do. I was a student here back then."

[MSG$015769,30]
I'd never heard that before...

[MSG$015794,101]
Kitami "They were the talk of the school, just like you are now. The resurrected coven of witches..."

[MSG$015813,45]
Minase "And what happened to those students?"

[MSG$01585A,97]
Kitami "They all died...The rumor was that they'd all been possessed by a demon who killed them."

[MSG$0158D5,50]
She says this calmly with a cold look on her face.

[MSG$015914,82]
Kitami "Look at you, so serious. Don't tell you really believe a story like that?"

[MSG$015980,26]
Minase "No...no, I don't."

[MSG$0159D3,41]
I look down to escape from Kitami's gaze.

[MSG$015A09,36]
Then I remember something important.

[MSG$015A42,21]
That's right...Saeki!

[MSG$015A64,62]
I'd forgotten all about her thanks to the incident with Inoue.

[MSG$015AA7,67]
I've got to get hold of her, now that I know she swapped the books.

[MSG$015AF7,81]
Everything started going out of whack since I let her get her hands on that book.

[MSG$015B4D,76]
If only I'd had the book on me, I might've been able to get away from Inoue.

[MSG$015BA6,83]
I don't know what she's got in mind, but I've got to get that book back from her...

[MSG$015C06,69]
I've got to get it back before she gets closer to the book's power...

[MSG$015C58,83]
I'm sure she has no rationale. It's too freaky to see her immerse herself in magic.

[MSG$015CB0,85]
Once she gets a taste of that book's power, there's no question that she'll abuse it.

[MSG$015D12,62]
And if I don't have that book, I'll never be able to stop her.

[MSG$015D55,30]
It's just like 12 years ago...

[MSG$015D80,31]
Kitami "All right, you're set."

[MSG$015DB9,48]
With that, Kitami applies a bandage to my wound.

[MSG$015DF6,36]
I look at it and slide off my chair.

[MSG$015E27,76]
I see that afternoon classes have already ended. There's a chance that Saeki

[MSG$015E78,36]
|might've already left the school...

[MSG$015EA9,23]
Minase "I'm going now."

[MSG$015EDA,36]
Kitami "What? But what about Imari?"

[MSG$015F18,22]
Minase "I'll be back."

[MSG$015F48,56]
That's all I say to her as I hurry out of the infirmary.

[MSG$015F8D,23]
April 24 - After School

[MSG$016089,12]
Door opening

[MSG$0160A2,68]
I enter the classroom and grab hold of Murai, who's standing nearby.

[MSG$016125,29]
Minase "Have you seen Saeki?"

[MSG$01615C,56]
Murai "Saeki? I haven't seen her since lunch...but why?"

[MSG$0161AF,43]
Just as I thought, she's already escaped...

[MSG$0161E7,33]
But her bag is still on her desk.

[MSG$016215,47]
Murai "She's probably in the campus infirmary."

[MSG$01625E,77]
No way. There was no sign of her in the infirmary. Where the hell did she go?

[MSG$0162B8,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$0162E0,72]
Murai "Oh, by the way, Minase, I have to talk to you about something..."

[MSG$016342,31]
Murai "Hey, are you listening?"

[MSG$0163F7,37]
Ignoring her, I rush out of the room.

[MSG$016429,37]
I head straight for the faculty room.

[MSG$016453,34]
I have a bad feeling about this...

[MSG$0164FE,12]
Door opening

[MSG$016517,50]
I open the door and head straight for the key box.

[MSG$0165A7,5]
Click

[MSG$016635,19]
Minase "It's gone!'

[MSG$016662,46]
There's no sign of the key to the Secret Room.

[MSG$016695,46]
I look everywhere, but there's no trace of it.

[MSG$0166D0,55]
Minase "I knew it...Saeki's gone down to the basement."

[MSG$016721,22]
That's got to be it...

[MSG$01673C,70]
Saeki must've gone downstairs to the basement with that book. But why?

[MSG$01678F,51]
Don't tell me she's going to try out that ritual...

[MSG$0167C7,36]
That book's got my notes in it, too.

[MSG$0167F8,56]
No, wait...I haven't finished deciphering that page yet.

[MSG$016835,65]
Surely even Saeki couldn't manage to decipher it in half a day...

[MSG$016883,51]
I have no choice but to go downstairs and find out.

[MSG$0168BB,86]
I don't mind going down there, but I don't like the idea of her taking the book there.

[MSG$01691E,108]
And worst of all, it's Saeki who took it. That's like jumping into a fire with a bomb strapped to your body.

[MSG$016A21,55]
I stop in front of the door with the ''No Entry'' sign.

[MSG$016A62,96]
I can see a faint light coming through the transom. Someone's definitely gone down those stairs.

[MSG$016AC7,30]
I put my hand on the doorknob.

[MSG$016AF2,8]
Click...

[MSG$016B07,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$016B2E,13]
Click, click!

[MSG$016B48,12]
It's locked.

[MSG$016B61,41]
There's no way this door could be locked.

[MSG$016B8F,65]
Did she lock it from inside? That means Saeki's still down there.

[MSG$016BDD,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$016C05,20]
Click, click, click!

[MSG$016C26,89]
I twist the knob over and over, venting all my frustration on the locked door. Of course,

[MSG$016C84,29]
that doesn't get me anywhere.

[MSG$016CAE,39]
Kitami "What are you doing down there?"

[MSG$016CEF,9]
Flinch...

[MSG$016D88,37]
Kitami is looking at me, exasperated.

[MSG$016DBA,42]
Kitami "Are you trying to break the door?"

[MSG$016DFE,83]
Kitami "You leave Imari lying in my office, and I find you in a place like this..."

[MSG$016E6B,53]
Hearing her, I quickly take my hand off the doorknob.

[MSG$016EAD,74]
Kitami "That room is forbidden. Students aren't allowed to go down there."

[MSG$016F11,57]
Kitami "Or do you have some kind of business down there?"

[MSG$016F64,28]
Minase "Uh, no, not really."

[MSG$016F9A,71]
Kitami "Don't tell me you had to go down there after hearing my story?"

[MSG$016FFB,27]
Minase "No, that's not it."

[MSG$017030,100]
Minase "I just saw some light coming from down there, so I tried to open the door, but it's locked."

[MSG$0170AE,52]
I give her the most plausible excuse I can think of.

[MSG$0170EF,65]
Kitami "That's strange. This door shouldn't be locked, you know."

[MSG$01714A,89]
Kitami "Never mind, I'll go down there and check it out. You go back and sit with Imari."

[MSG$0171BD,14]
Minase "What?"

[MSG$0171E5,23]
But that's pointless...

[MSG$017209,76]
Kitami "You two are close, aren't you? Then you should take care of her, and

[MSG$01725A,32]
walk her home, don't you think?"

[MSG$017294,55]
She looks exasperated. True, I do owe Imari big time...

[MSG$0172D8,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$017307,21]
Reluctantly, I leave.

[MSG$017329,21]
Kitami "Go on, then."

[MSG$017358,24]
Kitami "Come on, hurry!"

[MSG$0173AE,21]
Reluctantly, I leave.

[MSG$0173C8,70]
I'm anxious about Saeki, but I can't go down there in front of Kitami.

[MSG$01741B,90]
Besides, as long as the door's locked, I can't do anything but wait for Saeki to come out.

[MSG$017482,42]
I have no choice but to retreat for now...

[MSG$0174B1,77]
If I can't go down there now, then I might as well just talk to her tomorrow.

[MSG$01750B,76]
Anyway, Saeki might not have gone downstairs, and even if she is down there,

[MSG$01755C,79]
she can't possibly perform that ritual without having deciphered it completely.

[MSG$0175B0,65]
If she realizes she can't do it, then I'm sure she'll give it up.

[MSG$0175FE,80]
Next time I see her, I'm going to get that book back even if I have to deck her.

[MSG$017653,50]
The damage should still be slight if I act fast...

[MSG$01768A,66]
I make my decision and head toward the infirmary to be with Imari.

[MSG$0176D9,15]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$0177D7,14]
The door opens

[MSG$0177F2,33]
I return to the campus infirmary.

[MSG$017818,22]
Imari is still asleep.

[MSG$0178B7,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$0178E4,63]
Imari is sleeping peacefully. You can hear her light breathing.

[MSG$017928,62]
I can't believe she can sleep so deeply after what happened...

[MSG$017973,50]
Minase "Imari...wake up! We're going home soon..."

[MSG$0179BF,66]
I'm impressed with Imari's ability to sleep as I shake her gently.

[MSG$017A0E,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017A3B,53]
Minase "I said wake up! Or I'm gonna leave you here."

[MSG$017A8A,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017AB7,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$017AD0,28]
Minase "Wake up! You idiot."

[MSG$017B06,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017B33,35]
Minase "Why don't you kiss my ass?"

[MSG$017B70,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017B9D,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$017BB6,71]
I'm ragging her mercilessly, but she still shows no signs of waking up.

[MSG$017C02,25]
That's unusual for Imari.

[MSG$017C28,63]
Who is she to talk, anyway? She's not waking up at all herself!

[MSG$017C74,19]
Why don't I just...

[MSG$017CB4,31]
Minase "Hey, wake the hell up!"

[MSG$017CED,19]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$017D0D,20]
I punch her breasts.

[MSG$017D2E,32]
They jiggle like punching balls.

[MSG$017D53,35]
Let's see how effective that was...

[MSG$017D83,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017DB0,8]
No good.

[MSG$017DC5,72]
Minase "Tougher than I thought. I'll have to do something more drastic."

[MSG$017E27,25]
Tickle, tickle, tickle...

[MSG$017E4D,34]
Next, I tickle Imari on her sides.

[MSG$017E7C,19]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$017EA9,25]
This doesn't work either.

[MSG$017ECF,45]
Minase "Don't be so unreasonable, Take that!"

[MSG$017F17,9]
Massaging

[MSG$017F2D,30]
I start massaging her breasts.

[MSG$017F58,36]
Huh...they're bigger than I thought.

[MSG$017F81,43]
So she's gotten big without my noticing it.

[MSG$017FB1,14]
What the hell.

[MSG$017FF3,19]
Minase "(snickers)"

[MSG$018020,29]
This is a golden opportunity.

[MSG$018042,63]
Now I can get back at her for always waking me up so violently.

[MSG$01808E,81]
I get a magic marker from the desk, remove the cap and bring it closer and closer

[MSG$0180E4,19]
|to Imari's face...

[MSG$018104,38]
Minase "Now you'll know how I feel..."

[MSG$018144,25]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$0181F3,44]
Minase "I think I'll let you off with this."

[MSG$018239,16]
Heh, heh, heh...

[MSG$01824E,50]
I can't wait to see Imari's face when she notices.

[MSG$01828D,14]
Imari "Mmm..."

[MSG$0182B5,85]
I quickly move my hands away from Imari's face as she starts to regain consciousness.

[MSG$01830F,47]
If she finds out what I did now she'll kill me.

[MSG$01834B,20]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$018486,10]
Getting up

[MSG$01849D,31]
Imari "What am I doing in bed?"

[MSG$0184D6,14]
Imari sits up.

[MSG$0184F1,5]
Whoa!

[MSG$018503,29]
Imari's not wearing anything.

[MSG$018525,34]
Her underwear is dazzling white...

[MSG$018554,70]
Imari "Oh, right, I just remembered! It was that guy named Shinjou..."

[MSG$0185B4,83]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$018621,75]
Imari's trembling from rage as she remembers what went down on the rooftop.

[MSG$018679,84]
Looks like she doesn't remember anything that happened after she lost consciousness.

[MSG$0186D2,88]
I'm glad, because it would complicate things if she remembered what happened in the gym.

[MSG$018737,65]
Imari "Oh, no, look at the time! The club meeting's over by now!"

[MSG$018792,53]
Imari "Huh? What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?"

[MSG$0187E1,53]
Imari notices that I'm staring at her and looks down.

[MSG$018823,16]
Minase "That..."

[MSG$01884D,23]
I point to Imari's bra.

[MSG$018871,12]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$018897,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$0188AF,48]
Imari looks down at her body for the first time.

[MSG$0189F7,47]
Imari "Augh! Don't look at me! Why am I naked?"

[MSG$018A40,24]
Imari "Don't tell me..."

[MSG$018A72,19]
Imari stares at me.

[MSG$018A8A,22]
As if I'm the culprit.

[MSG$018AAD,49]
Minase "It wasn't me! That's a false accusation!"

[MSG$018AF8,34]
Imari "I don't know about that..."

[MSG$018B34,96]
I'm being wrongly accused. All I did was come back to wake her up. And this is the thanks I get.

[MSG$018B99,57]
Anyway, Kitami didn't have to take off all her clothes...

[MSG$018BDF,55]
Imari "Stop staring at me, already! Close the curtain!"

[MSG$018C30,5]
Snap!

[MSG$018C42,35]
I close the curtain around her bed.

[MSG$018C72,77]
Imari, clad only in her underwear, and I gaze at each other in the dim light.

[MSG$018CCC,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$018CF2,24]
Imari "Get out of here!"

[MSG$018DB9,7]
Thwack!

[MSG$018DCD,19]
Roll, roll, roll...

[MSG$018E69,76]
She kicks me sharply and I go flying through the curtain and onto the floor.

[MSG$018EC2,67]
I was just trying to lift her spirits, and my plan backfired on me.

[MSG$018F0A,57]
But if she's got that much energy, she must be all right.

[MSG$01909C,28]
Imari "You saw, didn't you?"

[MSG$0190D2,15]
Minase "I saw."

[MSG$0190FB,31]
Imari and I walk home together.

[MSG$019127,18]
Imari "Pervert..."

[MSG$019153,94]
Minase "Look, I told you! It was Kitami who undressed you, and what happened was an accident."

[MSG$0191CB,83]
Imari "Oh, never mind. There's nothing I can do now, since you've already seen me."

[MSG$019238,83]
Imari "And besides, it looks like you saved me from those jerks after the fight..."

[MSG$0192A6,45]
Why does she have to blame me for everything?

[MSG$0192E0,71]
Imari "If you buy me some ice cream on the way home, I'll forgive you."

[MSG$019341,28]
Imari "A triple, of course."

[MSG$019377,107]
She's talking about this ice cream in a shop on the way home; it's 3 layers of mint, vanilla and chocolate.

[MSG$0193EF,92]
Imari has a weird ritual: she eats one layer a day, taking 3 days to finish the huge carton.

[MSG$019458,25]
Minase "Are you serious?"

[MSG$01948B,62]
Minase "Anyway, it's cold out now. It's not ice cream season!"

[MSG$0194E3,93]
Imari "It doesn't matter. Connoisseurs eat cold stuff in cold weather, didn't you know that?"

[MSG$01955A,39]
Imari "Come on, it's not a lot to ask."

[MSG$01959B,30]
Minase "All right, all right."

[MSG$0195D3,66]
Exasperated, I check my pockets to see how much change I've got...

[MSG$01961A,45]
This is why women are such a pain in the ass.

[MSG$019672,50]
Imari "You know what, I just realized something...

[MSG$0196A9,48]
Everyone who passes by seems to be staring at me

[MSG$0196DE,20]
|for some reason..."

[MSG$01970C,9]
Whoops...

[MSG$019722,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$01973B,42]
Imari "Is there something funny about me?"

[MSG$01977F,23]
Imari "Well? Is there?"

[MSG$0197B0,49]
Yes, there's something extremely weird about her.

[MSG$0197EE,32]
Minase "I don't see anything..."

[MSG$019828,73]
Minase "I bet everyone's staring at you because you're so pretty, Imari."

[MSG$01988B,16]
Heh, heh, heh...

[MSG$0198A0,52]
I say this even though I don't mean it in the least.

[MSG$019913,46]
Imari "Really? Do you really think that's it?"

[MSG$01995B,31]
Imari blushes and laughs shyly.

[MSG$01997F,89]
Seeing her blush like that with the drawing on her face makes her look incredibly stupid.

[MSG$0199E5,46]
Imari "I see...everyone thinks I'm cute, huh?"

[MSG$019A2D,38]
Imari "Am I really that good-looking?"

[MSG$019A6D,79]
So saying, Imari stops to look at her reflection in the window of a parked car.

[MSG$019AC1,21]
Moron, don't do that!

[MSG$019AE3,21]
Imari "Hahaha...HUH?"

[MSG$019B44,13]
Imari "What?"

[MSG$019B6B,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$019B83,38]
Imari sees her reflection and freezes.

[MSG$019BAE,17]
Shit, I'm busted.

[MSG$019BCC,15]
Imari "MINASE!"

[MSG$019BF5,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$019C1B,44]
Imari starts shaking like a malaria patient.

[MSG$019C4C,19]
This is really bad.

[MSG$019C6C,27]
Imari "I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$019CA1,21]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$019DC3,5]
Click

[MSG$019DD5,18]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$019E01,40]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$019E36,71]
I'm all beaten up from the torture Imari subjected me to on the street.

[MSG$019E8A,97]
Imari was so carried away by her rage that she used me as a punching bag and went home in a huff.

[MSG$019EFE,18]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$019F2A,61]
I reach home as usual, take off my shoes and head to my room.

[MSG$019F74,26]
April 24 - Night/Your Room

[MSG$01A026,64]
I sink down into my chair, exhausted, and open my bag as always.

[MSG$01A073,48]
Minase "Oh, that's right, Saeki's got the book."

[MSG$01A0BD,49]
There's an empty space inside my bag again today.

[MSG$01A0FB,65]
Minase "I've got to get that book back, no matter what it takes."

[MSG$01A156,54]
Damn that Saeki, what the hell's she thinking, anyway?

[MSG$01A191,52]
Thanks to Saeki, I got into a load of trouble today.

[MSG$01A1D2,92]
I start thinking about all the complaints I can make to Saeki tomorrow to get the book back,

[MSG$01A233,21]
and flop onto my bed.

[MSG$01A255,15]
Minase "(sigh)"

[MSG$01A27E,108]
All those notes I took so painstakingly are still stuck inside that book. I have absolutely nothing on hand.

[MSG$01A2F7,75]
The last few days, I'd been engrossed in that book, and now that it's gone,

[MSG$01A347,36]
everything seems so anticlimactic...

[MSG$01A378,68]
Now that I think of it, ever since I found that book, it's owned me.

[MSG$01A3C9,50]
I lie there in a daze. I can feel time going by...

[MSG$01A42F,58]
After I've had dinner and taken a bath, I go to bed early.

[MSG$01A476,81]
Why not just forget about that book for one night and get a good night's sleep...

[MSG$01A4CC,38]
Whatever happens tomorrow will happen.

[MSG$01A527,18]
..................

[MSG$01A546,12]
............

[MSG$01A55F,6]
......

[MSG$01A57E,43]
I look down to get away from Kitami's gaze.

[MSG$01A5B6,106]
It's not a question of believing...I've seen that basement room. It would be impossible not to believe it.

[MSG$01A62D,15]
That's right...

[MSG$01A641,54]
I remember that I was planning to go down there again.

[MSG$01A68C,98]
Now that I've deciphered that ritual from 12 years ago, I'm going down there to have another look.

[MSG$01A6FB,50]
The only clues I have are that room and that book.

[MSG$01A732,107]
As long as I'm going to use that Book of Magic, the incident from 12 years ago will always stand in my way.

[MSG$01A7AA,74]
It might be dangerous to keep that book unless I find out what happened...

[MSG$01A7F9,94]
I can't even deny the fact that there's a chance I might come to the same end as those others.

[MSG$01A864,31]
Kitami "All right, you're set."

[MSG$01A89D,48]
With that, Kitami applies a bandage to my wound.

[MSG$01A8DA,36]
I look at it and slide off my chair.

[MSG$01A90B,82]
I see that afternoon classes have already ended. It might be the perfect timing...

[MSG$01A96A,23]
Minase "I'm going now."

[MSG$01A99B,36]
Kitami "What? But what about Imari?"

[MSG$01A9D9,22]
Minase "I'll be back."

[MSG$01AA09,56]
That's all I say to her as I hurry out of the infirmary.

[MSG$01AA4E,23]
April 24 - After School

[MSG$01AAE4,14]
The door opens

[MSG$01AB7C,98]
Book in hand, I enter the faculty room, and quickly pick out the key to the basement storage room.

[MSG$01ABE3,48]
The key's lying right there where I last saw it.

[MSG$01AC20,88]
I put it in my pocket, quickly leave the faculty room and head for the 1st floor stairs.

[MSG$01AD01,76]
I make sure nobody's around, then quietly open the door marked ''No Entry.''

[MSG$01ADD2,97]
I flick on the switch, turning on the stair lights. As soon as I do, I can make out the dimly lit

[MSG$01AE38,39]
|outline of the stairs in the darkness.

[MSG$01AE6C,31]
Slowly, I walk down the stairs.

[MSG$01AE98,19]
Thump, thump, thump

[MSG$01AF34,79]
When I get to the bottom of the stairs, my way is blocked by a cold steel door.

[MSG$01AF88,64]
I take the key from my pocket, stick it in the keyhole and turn.

[MSG$01AFD5,8]
Click...

[MSG$01AFEA,5]
Creak

[MSG$01AFFC,32]
I open the steel door and enter.

[MSG$01B029,24]
April 24 - Basement Room

[MSG$01B140,75]
Using the lighter in my pocket, I manage to light a candle in the darkness.

[MSG$01B190,68]
I can now make out the unchanged sight of the altar in the darkness.

[MSG$01B1E1,80]
This is where those students summoned a demon for the last time, 12 years ago...

[MSG$01B23E,37]
This place still gives me the creeps.

[MSG$01B270,75]
The moldy, cold air, the stains all over the room, and the magic circles...

[MSG$01B2C0,53]
They're all here as if they've been frozen in time...

[MSG$01B353,78]
I walk toward the center of the room, gazing at the Book of Magic in my hands.

[MSG$01B3AE,82]
The last ritual that leads those who've read this book to their final destination.

[MSG$01B40D,82]
The power all magicians dream about. Controlling evil, making it do their bidding.

[MSG$01B464,41]
Just like King Solomon, long, long ago...

[MSG$01B49A,63]
This room has borne witness to how those people met their ends.

[MSG$01B4E6,31]
I start investigating the room.

[MSG$01B50A,113]
Before, I didn't know what to expect, so I was confused. That was why I wasn't able to give the room a good look.

[MSG$01B588,45]
But I don't really find anything substantial.

[MSG$01B5C2,70]
The only thing I do find is that there are seven big bloodstains here.

[MSG$01B615,53]
If I remember correctly, Saeki had said there were 6.

[MSG$01B64F,82]
But that can be explained by assuming that Saeki merely got the wrong information.

[MSG$01B6AE,83]
My findings are below expectations, and I stand there at a loss in the silent room.

[MSG$01B797,113]
I decide to try something else and unwrap the book. Flipping through the pages, I find the section about rituals.

[MSG$01B815,65]
So all I have to help me find the truth is this book after all...

[MSG$01B863,36]
I kick away the dust from the floor.

[MSG$01B894,84]
The dust rises into the air, and I can make out the clear outline of a magic circle.

[MSG$01B8ED,73]
I give it a closer look, and I find it's the same as the one in the book.

[MSG$01B943,57]
Then I pick up the cross-shaped sword lying on the floor.

[MSG$01B981,43]
The letter ''A'' is engraved on the pommel.

[MSG$01B9B9,61]
I grip it in my hands, and slowly step into the magic circle.

[MSG$01BA80,95]
I have the sword in one hand, and the book in the other. I try out the ritual at the beginning.

[MSG$01BAEC,78]
I trace the edge of the white circle on the floor with the point of the sword.

[MSG$01BB3F,97]
Of course, I'm only doing this in a casual way. I have no intention of really opening the gate...

[MSG$01BBAD,58]
Before I realize it, I'm reciting the chant from the book.

[MSG$01BBF4,54]
Minase "O Lord, we are about to fly towards thy power.

[MSG$01BC2F,44]
O Lord, we ask that you recognize our work."

[MSG$01BC75,50]
In that moment, I can feel the tension in the air.

[MSG$01BCAC,20]
I continue to chant.

[MSG$01BCCD,85]
Minase "That power which we now use is no more than the dust that swirls in the wind.

[MSG$01BD27,111]
And we will be visited by an Angel of God. Extinguish the darkness, and pursue the Angel of God for  eternity."

[MSG$01BDB0,62]
Minase "Alpha, Omega, Elohi, Elohim, Sabaoth, Elion, Sadai..."

[MSG$01BE08,53]
There are no windows in this room, but I feel a wind.

[MSG$01BE4A,67]
I pay no attention and use the sword to trace the circle clockwise.

[MSG$01BE9A,87]
The sound of the blade scratching blends with the sound of my voice reciting the chant,

[MSG$01BEF6,67]
becoming a strange rhythm that echoes throughout the closed room...

[MSG$01BF46,39]
Forgetting myself, I continue to chant.

[MSG$01BF7A,52]
Minase "We shall open the book with the Seven Seals.

[MSG$01BFB3,77]
We shall see Satan as he falls to earth from heaven in a flash of lightning."

[MSG$01C01A,96]
Minase "You have endowed us with the power to smite dragons, scorpions, and all of your enemies,

[MSG$01C07F,48]
Nothing exists that can put us in harm's way..."

[MSG$01C0C9,77]
Minase "Elohi, Elohim, Sabaoth, Elion, Eschiros, Adonai, Jah, Tetragrammaton,

[MSG$01C11B,7]
Sadai!"

[MSG$01C13C,56]
Just then, the magic circle begins to glow bluish-white.

[MSG$01C179,36]
I sense this, and continue to chant.

[MSG$01C1AA,50]
But I'm about to reach the main part of the chant.

[MSG$01C1E1,50]
If I recite any more I won't be able to go back...

[MSG$01C220,40]
I realize this, yet I can't stop myself.

[MSG$01C255,91]
Minase "O living sacrifice, savior of the spirits, thou who shall open the gates of heaven.

[MSG$01C2B5,77]
Our enemies challenge us in battle, therefore we need thy power and thy aid."

[MSG$01C31E,25]
Voice "Stop right there!"

[MSG$01C351,55]
Just then, I hear a voice shouting at me from the door.

[MSG$01C395,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$01C3AD,89]
I stop chanting. I snap out of my trance and look to see whose voice it was I just heard.

[MSG$01C49E,20]
Minase "Dr. Kitami?"

[MSG$01C4CC,34]
Kitami is standing in the doorway.

[MSG$01C4FB,61]
But she was just in the infirmary. How could she be here now?

[MSG$01C53D,32]
Don't tell me she'd followed me?

[MSG$01C56A,65]
Also, now that I think about it, I'm sure that I locked the door.

[MSG$01C5B0,32]
So how the hell did she open it?

[MSG$01C5DD,33]
Minase "What are you doing here?"

[MSG$01C618,46]
Kitami "I came to rescue you, ignorant boy..."

[MSG$01C660,67]
Kitami "Don't tell me you were really intending to summon a demon?"

[MSG$01C6BD,35]
So saying, Kitami walks towards me.

[MSG$01C6ED,51]
Kitami "I haven't seen that book in a long time..."

[MSG$01C73A,51]
She says this as she gazes at the book I'm holding.

[MSG$01C77A,49]
Kitami "That book is very convenient, you know...

[MSG$01C7B0,91]
It contains many demonic secrets that were said to have been handed down from the Devil..."

[MSG$01C825,114]
Kitami "The fruit forbidden by God. Those humans from Biblical times ate the forbidden fruit and felt God's wrath.

[MSG$01C89C,39]
They were cursed and driven from Eden."

[MSG$01C8DD,109]
Kitami "Do you know why? Those who eat that fruit become God's equal. Because God was so fearful and jealous,

[MSG$01C94F,82]
he made it a sin for them to eat it and used that as a pretext to drive them out."

[MSG$01C9BB,106]
Kitami "In other words, that book is the forbidden fruit of knowledge. And those who partake of this fruit

[MSG$01CA2A,38]
|can become closer in stature to God."

[MSG$01CA6A,30]
Minase "How do you know that?"

[MSG$01CAA2,55]
I'm wary of Kitami's words as I grip the Book of Magic.

[MSG$01CAE6,90]
Kitami "Because I practice what's in that book. You tried to use it yourself, didn't you?"

[MSG$01CB5A,88]
Kitami "I'm the only one who witnessed that ritual 12 years ago from start to finish..."

[MSG$01CBCC,38]
With that, Kitami smiles eerily at me.

[MSG$01CBF7,67]
The way she puts it, it sounds like she was a member of that coven.

[MSG$01CC47,59]
Minase "Those people from back then all died, didn't they?"

[MSG$01CC9C,59]
Kitami "Yes, they died...It was a total bloodbath in here."

[MSG$01CCF1,59]
I don't get what she's saying. I stare at her suspiciously.

[MSG$01CD31,70]
Kitami's just trying to trick me. She's using her words to confuse me.

[MSG$01CD84,96]
Kitami "Don't look at me like that. Do I look like a ghost to you? I've got two feet, you know."

[MSG$01CDFE,45]
She gives me a cold smile when she says this.

[MSG$01CE38,104]
She said she uses the power, too. If that's the case, then does she know more about this book than I do?

[MSG$01CEA5,102]
Besides that, I can't believe there was someone else at school other than me who knew about this book.

[MSG$01CF18,98]
Minase "So, what kind of business does a witch have with me? Have you come to get this book back?"

[MSG$01CF95,27]
Kitami "No, that's not it."

[MSG$01CFCA,94]
Kitami "If you want that book, you can have it. But only if you're one of my kind, of course."

[MSG$01D042,34]
Minase "What do you mean by that?"

[MSG$01D07E,33]
Kitami "I've come to invite you."

[MSG$01D0B9,19]
Minase "Invite me?"

[MSG$01D0E6,22]
Kitami "That's right."

[MSG$01D116,90]
Kitami "You're someone who's been lured by magic, just like I was. I've come to save you."

[MSG$01D18A,50]
Kitami stares right into my eyes as she says this.

[MSG$01D1C9,68]
Kitami "You want to find out the truth. The truth about this world."

[MSG$01D227,108]
Kitami "To have the same power as a god. To obtain the kind of divine power no human can ever hope to have."

[MSG$01D2DF,75]
Kitami "If you desire it, you can claim it for yourself. Just like I have."

[MSG$01D344,43]
With that, Kitami's smile twists her mouth.

[MSG$01D37C,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$01D394,71]
Kitami "That's right...12 years ago, I acquired that power right here."

[MSG$01D3F5,75]
Kitami "12 years ago, I saw Hell with my own eyes. The Hell of this world."

[MSG$01D45A,83]
Kitami "And it was while I was in that Hell that I made a contract with the Devil."

[MSG$01D4C7,73]
You mean she acquired the power of the ruler of Hell during that ritual?!

[MSG$01D51D,24]
But that's impossible...

[MSG$01D53A,34]
I mean, wasn't it a failed ritual?

[MSG$01D569,38]
Kitami "You don't believe me, do you?"

[MSG$01D5A9,84]
Kitami "But I survived the ritual. I'm the sole survivor of that session in Hell..."

[MSG$01D617,81]
Kitami "Don't you want to have that power, too? More power than you can imagine?"

[MSG$01D682,105]
Kitami "It's the kind of power all magicians dream about. Every living entity will bow before you. If you

[MSG$01D6F0,30]
|wish it, the entire world..."

[MSG$01D728,91]
Kitami "If you do as I say, I'll show you that dream. Of course, you have nothing to fear."

[MSG$01D79D,32]
So saying, Kitami bites her lip.

[MSG$01D7CA,62]
Kitami "If you become my partner, it will take a load off me."

[MSG$01D822,100]
Kitami "You only have to do as I tell you. That's all you have to do to acquire power and pleasure."

[MSG$01D8A0,98]
Kitami "This is a transaction. You desire...I provide. But you have to satisfy my every desire..."

[MSG$01D90F,69]
Kitami "Just do as I say. Together we can usher in a new millennium."

[MSG$01D96E,78]
Kitami "Now then...what's it going to be, Minase? I want to hear your answer."

[MSG$01DA16,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$01DA45,58]
Unable to put up any more resistance, I give in to Kitami.

[MSG$01DA8C,52]
At this point, I might as well fall as far as I can.

[MSG$01DAC5,76]
Even if I try to reject her advances in my mind, my body has another agenda.

[MSG$01DB1E,52]
From the moment I was convinced of the book's power,

[MSG$01DB57,85]
I knew somewhere deep down inside that I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation...

[MSG$01DBB9,111]
It turns out that I'm just like those students from 12 years ago. I won't be satisfied unless I go all the way.

[MSG$01DC2D,32]
Even if it's the road to hell...

[MSG$01DC5A,31]
Kitami "I'm glad you said yes."

[MSG$01DC93,105]
Kitami "All right, then, I'm going to teach you everything I know... About the wonders of the Dark Arts."

[MSG$01DD16,29]
Kitami "Now then, come here."

[MSG$01DD4D,57]
Unsteadily, I fall into her arms, offering no resistance.

[MSG$01DD8B,56]
She puts her hand on my neck, and her mouth over mine...

[MSG$01DEC3,16]
Minase "(gulps)"

[MSG$01DEED,20]
Slither...slither...

[MSG$01DF0E,58]
Soon, Kitami's long tongue pushes its way between my lips.

[MSG$01DF55,15]
Kitami "Mmm..."

[MSG$01DF7E,18]
Minase "(Gulping)"

[MSG$01DFAA,72]
Having someone else's tongue crawling all over the inside of my mouth...

[MSG$01DFF7,27]
It was a strange sensation.

[MSG$01E01F,61]
I'm unable to resist, so I just let her have her way with me.

[MSG$01E061,52]
And soon I'm intoxicated with the sweet sensation...

[MSG$01E0A2,81]
Our tongues are eventually entwined, and our saliva mixes together in our mouths.

[MSG$01E0F8,19]
I suck it greedily.

[MSG$01E118,66]
We stay that way for a long time, then Kitami finally releases me.

[MSG$01E1E0,14]
Minase 'Ah..."

[MSG$01E208,29]
We pull away from each other.

[MSG$01E22A,77]
There's a thread of our saliva stretching between us. It falls to the ground.

[MSG$01E284,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01E2BA,73]
Kitami "Now then, get yourself out of those clothes. Show me all of you!"

[MSG$01E396,26]
I let Kitami undress me...

[MSG$01E3BD,59]
She tosses my pants, my jacket, and my shorts on the floor.

[MSG$01E405,23]
Soon I'm stark naked...

[MSG$01E429,73]
I'm embarrassed that my crotch is plain view, so I cover it with my hand.

[MSG$01E47F,77]
Kitami "You can't do anything if your hand's there. Come on, out of the way!"

[MSG$01E55F,12]
Minase "Oh!"

[MSG$01E585,27]
Kitami pushes my hand away.

[MSG$01E5AD,58]
Kitami "Well, now...you have pretty good equipment there."

[MSG$01E601,49]
Kitami "And it's already hard from anticipation."

[MSG$01E64C,59]
My prick has been erect since our kissing session just now.

[MSG$01E694,47]
Kitami "First of all, I'm going to eat you up."

[MSG$01E6DD,59]
With that, she pushes her lips against the tip of my prick.

[MSG$01E79E,53]
My rigid penis gradually disappears inside her mouth.

[MSG$01E7E0,14]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$01E808,55]
Kitami skillfully manipulates my dick inside her mouth.

[MSG$01E84C,13]
She's good...

[MSG$01E866,55]
She wraps her hot tongue around my penis, sucking hard.

[MSG$01E8A2,61]
From time to time, she stimulates my urethra with her tongue.

[MSG$01E8EC,99]
The pleasure's so intense I'm ready to melt. I'm in a daze as I let myself get lost in the ecstasy.

[MSG$01E954,84]
If it means I can get a taste of this, then falling to the Dark Arts isn't so bad...

[MSG$01EA2E,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$01EA56,39]
Kitami grips my balls in her free hand.

[MSG$01EA82,75]
While she continues to caress my prick in her mouth, she massages my balls.

[MSG$01EADA,28]
Minase "(Breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01EB10,31]
Kitami "Go ahead...let it out."

[MSG$01EB49,69]
Kitami "You're not going to be satisfied by coming just once, right?"

[MSG$01EBA8,54]
Minase "(Breathing heavily) Can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$01EBF8,38]
Kitami "Do you want me to swallow it?"

[MSG$01EC58,48]
Minase "Swallow it...hurry up...I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$01ECA2,65]
I say this, desperately trying to hold back my urge to ejaculate.

[MSG$01ECF0,34]
Kitami "I guess I have no choice."

[MSG$01EDA9,76]
Once again she pushes her mouth against my prick and slowly slips it inside.

[MSG$01EE02,8]
Slide...

[MSG$01EE17,34]
Minase "Can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$01EF45,21]
Throb! Twitch! Throb!

[MSG$01EF67,26]
Minase "Augh! Whoa! Ahhh!"

[MSG$01EF9B,75]
As soon as she puts my cock in her mouth I begin to ejaculate relentlessly.

[MSG$01EFF3,48]
I'm writhing as I begin to twitch and shoot off.

[MSG$01F030,13]
Gulp, gulp...

[MSG$01F04A,77]
As her mouth fills with the heady-smelling cum, she swallows it down noisily.

[MSG$01F0A4,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$01F0C4,53]
The stimulation's so strong I can't stop ejaculating.

[MSG$01F106,119]
There's so much cum and I'm shooting off so hard that it starts to overflow from Kitami's mouth, running down her chin.

[MSG$01F182,54]
She can't take it and removes my prick from her mouth.

[MSG$01F23E,8]
Splat...

[MSG$01F253,18]
Kitami "(gagging)"

[MSG$01F27F,63]
Kitami "Really! That's too much cum, I can't swallow all that!"

[MSG$01F2D8,88]
With that, Kitami starts to lick away the thick white semen collecting around her mouth.

[MSG$01F33D,35]
Kitami "You're still shooting off."

[MSG$01F37A,71]
After popping out from Kitami's mouth, my prick continues to spray cum.

[MSG$01F3CE,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01F404,52]
I'm totally wiped out and I fall over in exhaustion.

[MSG$01F450,40]
Minase "Can I just...come all over you?"

[MSG$01F492,65]
I say this, desperately trying to hold back my urge to ejaculate.

[MSG$01F4E0,29]
Kitami "All right, go ahead."

[MSG$01F517,34]
Kitami "Cover me in your juice..."

[MSG$01F553,75]
I can't take it anymore, and I start jerking off with my prick in my hands.

[MSG$01F5AB,16]
Rub, rub, rub...

[MSG$01F5C8,66]
I'm already stimulated, so it's not long before I'm ready to come.

[MSG$01F617,26]
Minase "Can't hold it in!"

[MSG$01F73D,21]
Throb! Twitch! Throb!

[MSG$01F75F,26]
Minase "Augh! Whoa! Ahhh!"

[MSG$01F793,38]
I spray my cum all over Kitami's body.

[MSG$01F7BE,79]
I'm twitching and ejaculating at the same time. I'm swooning from the pleasure.

[MSG$01F81A,22]
Splat, splat, splat...

[MSG$01F83D,55]
My frothy white cum rains down on her face and breasts.

[MSG$01F879,33]
She doesn't even try to dodge it.

[MSG$01F8A7,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$01F8C7,53]
The stimulation's so strong I can't stop ejaculating.

[MSG$01F909,37]
The cum starts running down her body.

[MSG$01F933,51]
Her face is already plastered with the thick juice.

[MSG$01F9EC,86]
Kitami "That's too much cum. Look at my face, it's all wet and sticky because of you."

[MSG$01FA5C,76]
So saying, she licks away the semen that rolls down her face near her mouth.

[MSG$01FAB5,33]
Kitami "And you're still coming."

[MSG$01FAF0,59]
There's still some juice Spurting from the tip of my prick.

[MSG$01FB38,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01FB6E,52]
I'm totally wiped out and I fall over in exhaustion.

[MSG$01FC2B,59]
Kitami "All right, now I'm going to eat you with my pussy."

[MSG$01FC80,33]
So saying, Kitami licks her lips.

[MSG$01FCAE,36]
But my prick is starting to go soft.

[MSG$01FCD7,86]
It can't be helped, since I came so hard just now. No way can I do it again so soon...

[MSG$01FD3A,32]
Minase "Let me rest a minute..."

[MSG$01FD74,62]
Kitami "Don't be such a wuss. We've only gotten started here."

[MSG$01FDCC,41]
Minase "But I can't do it again so soon."

[MSG$01FE0F,42]
Kitami "Don't worry, just leave it to me."

[MSG$01FE53,87]
With that, Kitami grabs my prick, fills her mouth with saliva and starts to spit it out

[MSG$01FEAF,12]
on my penis.

[MSG$01FEC8,35]
Kitami "O Uvall, Amon, Astaroth..."

[MSG$01FF05,77]
As she whispers, she begins to pump my prick, now glistening with her saliva.

[MSG$01FF5F,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$01FF85,90]
The saliva has a lubricating effect. Her hand slips and slides as she continues to rub me.

[MSG$01FFEC,69]
As she continues the hand job, my prick gets even harder than before.

[MSG$020036,68]
The veins are distended, and it's twitching as if I'm about to come.

[MSG$020087,38]
Kitami "Now you can do it, can't you?"

[MSG$0200C7,60]
My prick pops erect in her hands. My whole body is tingling.

[MSG$020110,72]
She sees what's happening, lets go of my penis and rips off her clothes.

[MSG$0201EE,51]
Kitami's well-built body is exposed before my eyes.

[MSG$02022E,7]
Gulp...

[MSG$020242,20]
I gulp at the sight.

[MSG$020263,62]
Right in front, right within my reach is Kitami's lewd crotch.

[MSG$0202A6,70]
My prick goes even more erect as I anticipate thrusting myself inside.

[MSG$0202F9,41]
Minase "Let...let me put my dick inside."

[MSG$02033C,41]
I ask her without even thinking about it.

[MSG$020372,87]
Kitami "You want to put it in me? You want to put that nasty engorged thing inside me?"

[MSG$0203E3,21]
Minase "Yes, I do..."

[MSG$020412,49]
I'm begging her. It's like I'm being manipulated.

[MSG$020450,58]
Kitami "What do you say when you ask someone for a favor?"

[MSG$0204A4,46]
Minase "Please let me put my dick inside you."

[MSG$0204EC,65]
I know how lame it must sound, but I beg her in a plaintive tone.

[MSG$020532,86]
Right now all I can think of is penetrating Kitami. I'll do anything if she'll let me.

[MSG$020595,21]
Kitami "All right..."

[MSG$0205C4,53]
Kitami "But first, I want you to lick me down there."

[MSG$020613,49]
I do as she says and lower my head to her crotch.

[MSG$020651,8]
Smack...

[MSG$020666,68]
I kiss the sensitive mound of her vulva, and suck it up in my mouth.

[MSG$0206AF,55]
Then I use my tongue to lick at her crevice like a dog.

[MSG$0206F3,13]
Lick, lick...

[MSG$020786,16]
Kitami "Ahhh..."

[MSG$0207B0,59]
Right away her juice starts flowing, and it hits my tongue.

[MSG$0207F0,56]
I let my tongue run all over her crevice, licking it up.

[MSG$020835,90]
Kitami "Mmm...Put your whole tongue inside. I want you to lick me thoroughly inside, too."

[MSG$0208A9,75]
I do as she says, sticking out my tongue and pushing it inside her crevice.

[MSG$0208F9,55]
I push away her labia, and my tongue disappears inside.

[MSG$02093D,7]
Lick...

[MSG$020951,101]
I sweep my tongue all over her vagina. At the same time I stimulate her clit with the tip of my nose.

[MSG$0209C3,55]
Kitami "That feels great...You're pretty good at this!"

[MSG$020A14,14]
Glub...glub...

[MSG$020A2F,42]
I continue to eat her out for a long time.

[MSG$020A5E,83]
Kitami starts breathing heavily as I bury my head in her crotch, totally out of it.

[MSG$020ABE,36]
Kitami "I'm just about ready now..."

[MSG$020AFC,67]
I remove my mouth from her crotch area as if I'm being peeled away.

[MSG$020B44,66]
The area around my mouth is sticky with saliva and Kitami's juice.

[MSG$020B93,55]
Kitami "All right, now I'm going to cleanse your body."

[MSG$020BE4,13]
Minase "...?"

[MSG$020BFE,55]
Kitami "You're going to baptized with my Holy Fluid..."

[MSG$020C4F,31]
Kitami "Stay still, now. Ahhh!"

[MSG$020D11,8]
Spurt...

[MSG$020D26,10]
(Spraying)

[MSG$020D3D,62]
Kitami "I hereby baptize this man, Taki Minase, in my name..."

[MSG$020D95,23]
Squirt, squirt, squirt!

[MSG$020DB9,20]
Minase "Whoa! Augh!"

[MSG$020DE7,95]
Suddenly a stream of amber-colored fluid sprays out from Kitami's crevice, splattering my face.

[MSG$020E53,41]
Kitami "Come on, drink it. Drink it now!"

[MSG$020E96,48]
I raise my face and catch the spray in my mouth.

[MSG$020ED3,30]
Minase "(gulping and gagging)"

[MSG$020F0B,94]
Kitami "O Almighty Ruler of Hell, you have blessed us with the ability to reproduce endlessly.

[MSG$020F6E,77]
Let those who wish to join us be reborn by the grace of this baptismal water,

[MSG$020FC0,110]
and so that they may become one of your beloved children, grant them now greater knowledge of your teachings."

[MSG$021048,71]
Kitami "I ask this in the name of our great rulers, Astaroth, Belzebub,

[MSG$021094,15]
and Lucifer..."

[MSG$021136,16]
Splat...splat...

[MSG$021153,31]
Minase "(Coughing and gulping)"

[MSG$02118C,57]
Finally she's done peeing, and I'm released from my task.

[MSG$0211CA,76]
I drank so much that it tastes like urine when I burp. I can't stop gagging.

[MSG$021223,41]
Kitami "Well done. Now you're one of us."

[MSG$021266,53]
Kitami "Okay, now it's my turn to let you inside me."

[MSG$0212B5,50]
With that, she places my prick against her crotch.

[MSG$0212F4,55]
Kitami "I'm going to give you the ultimate pleasure..."

[MSG$021345,74]
Kitami "It's the kind of pleasure you normally wouldn't get to experience.

[MSG$021394,46]
Don't hold back...get as aroused as you want."

[MSG$0213DC,38]
With that, Kitami slowly sinks down...

[MSG$0214B1,16]
Kitami "Augh..."

[MSG$0214DB,16]
Glub, glub, glub

[MSG$0214F8,16]
Minase "Augh..."

[MSG$021522,38]
My prick is skewering Kitami's crotch.

[MSG$021555,105]
The head of my penis shoves through her crevice. I watch it slowly disappear inside her, and a feeling of

[MSG$0215C3,67]
intense pleasure takes over my own crotch until I'm ready to swoon.

[MSG$021613,94]
A bigger wave of pleasure than the one I felt when she was giving me head sweeps over my body.

[MSG$021707,48]
Kitami "Well? How does it feel to be inside me?"

[MSG$021751,61]
She's looking at me with a lewd smile on her face as I swoon.

[MSG$021793,72]
I look down and see that my prick is inserted up her vagina all the way.

[MSG$0217E8,32]
Minase "It feels...really good."

[MSG$021822,20]
I answer in a groan.

[MSG$021843,26]
If I lose focus I'll come.

[MSG$021862,98]
Kitami's vagina seems to have a life of its own. It envelopes my prick, squirming all the while...

[MSG$0218D1,58]
Kitami "I'm going to move now...keep your head about you."

[MSG$021925,53]
With that, Kitami begins to slowly churn up and down.

[MSG$021967,18]
Squish...squish...

[MSG$021986,14]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$0219AE,70]
The second she starts moving, I start convulsing from the stimulation.

[MSG$0219F9,61]
It feels as if my whole body has become one big sexual organ.

[MSG$021A43,56]
Kitami "Well...I've only just gotten started, you know."

[MSG$021A95,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$021ABB,66]
Just like she said, it's a pleasure so intense I'm ready to faint.

[MSG$021B02,78]
I feel like my brain's going to melt. I come close to fainting numerous times.

[MSG$021B5D,45]
We lie together on top of the magic circle...

[MSG$021B8F,84]
I'm writhing on top of that mysterious diagram. It's like I'm being raped by Kitami.

[MSG$021BF0,67]
A priest being raped by the devil...that's the perfect description.

[MSG$021C40,92]
I'm lying underneath Kitami, and I have no choice but let her do whatever she wants with me.

[MSG$021CA1,28]
I can't even move on my own.

[MSG$021CC2,33]
If I tried, I'd come in a second.

[MSG$021CF0,82]
We're both moaning, and the sound of our voices echo across the room like a chant.

[MSG$021D4F,55]
Kitami "Well? Isn't this the best sex you've ever had?"

[MSG$021DA0,62]
Minase "It's the best, all right. I can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$021DF8,40]
Kitami "You can't come yet. Hold it in!"

[MSG$021E3A,55]
Minase "But you don't understand...I can't hold it in!"

[MSG$021E8B,108]
Kitami "Don't worry. All of your senses are under my control. Even if you want to come, it won't be possible

[MSG$021EFC,23]
|unless I want you to."

[MSG$021F2D,36]
Minase "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$021F6B,63]
But come to think of it, even though I've had the urge to come,

[MSG$021FAF,65]
I keep getting the sensation that I'm being forced to hold it in.

[MSG$021FFD,50]
And the pleasure keeps ebbing and flowing as well.

[MSG$022034,33]
All because she's controlling me?

[MSG$022062,108]
Kitami "So? Normally, you'd have come long ago. But I'm stretching it out, making you last a little longer."

[MSG$0220E8,33]
Kitami "Pretty stimulating, huh?"

[MSG$022123,36]
She pumps her hips as she says this.

[MSG$022154,44]
Desperately I try to endure the stimulation.

[MSG$02218D,84]
There's no way for me to relieve myself of this torture-like pleasure unless I come.

[MSG$0221E6,37]
But since she won't allow me to come,

[MSG$022210,36]
I have no choice but to hold back...

[MSG$022241,34]
But I've already reached my limit.

[MSG$022268,52]
If I hold it back any longer, I'm going to go crazy.

[MSG$0222A9,42]
Minase "Let me come now! I'm going crazy!"

[MSG$0222ED,32]
Desperately I plead with Kitami.

[MSG$022312,73]
If she keeps stringing me along like this, I know I'm going to go insane.

[MSG$022368,99]
It's like I've inhaled a lethal dose of marijuana...This pleasure that I'm unable to control myself

[MSG$0223D0,46]
|has far exceeded the bounds of rationality...

[MSG$02240B,40]
Kitami "So you're almost at your limit?'

[MSG$02244D,48]
Kitami "All right, then, I'll let you come now."

[MSG$022497,75]
Kitami "I'll even let you come inside me. Now doesn't that make you happy?"

[MSG$0224FC,52]
Minase "Makes me really happy...so let me come now!"

[MSG$02254A,43]
Kitami "All right. Let it all out at once!"

[MSG$02258F,54]
With that, Kitami starts pumping her hips even faster.

[MSG$0225CA,46]
At the same time, my orgasm peaks all at once.

[MSG$022605,27]
Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat!

[MSG$02262D,75]
The sound of our bodies knocking against each other echoes across the room.

[MSG$022685,116]
Kitami "All right, all right! You want to come, don't you? You want to unload your dirty cum inside me, don't  you?"

[MSG$022713,42]
Minase "I'm gonna come! Augh! I'm coming!"

[MSG$022757,69]
Kitami "Come inside me. I want you to let it all out inside my womb!"

[MSG$0227B6,16]
Minase "Ahhhhh!"

[MSG$0227E0,118]
In that instant, my mind goes blank. I ejaculate so hard inside Kitami that it feels like my prick is going to  burst.

[MSG$0228DC,20]
Throb, throb, throb!

[MSG$022976,63]
Kitami "I can feel you coming. You're coming all over my womb."

[MSG$0229CF,14]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$0229F7,20]
Spurt! Splat! Splat!

[MSG$022A18,48]
I continue to come. It's like I'm taking a piss.

[MSG$022A55,89]
I continue to spray cum from my dick. Kitami's vagina wrings out every last drop of semen

[MSG$022AB3,18]
|pooled inside me.

[MSG$022AD2,37]
Kitami "Oh, my, you're still coming."

[MSG$022B11,91]
Kitami "You're my servant now. All right, I'm going to grant you the power I promised you."

[MSG$022B86,77]
Kitami "You're still too inexperienced to have a high-level spirit serve you.

[MSG$022BD8,55]
So I'm going to give you my own demon-servant, an Imp."

[MSG$022C29,47]
Kitami "This is Rasha the Imp. Accept him now."

[MSG$022C72,48]
Kitami's voice cuts through the haze in my mind.

[MSG$022CA7,85]
I still haven't stopped coming, and I'm convulsing and shivering from the pleasure...

[MSG$022D09,94]
Kitami "Sign this contract with me. Swear that you'll be loyal, and will bring me pleasure..."

[MSG$022D81,52]
As she chants, she pushes her long nails against me.

[MSG$022DC2,52]
Her sharp nails dig into my flesh, and draw blood...

[MSG$022E03,64]
And she scratches my body with her nails as she moves her hands.

[MSG$022E48,43]
I twist my body from the pain and pleasure.

[MSG$022F09,68]
When she's left a triangular mark on my body, she removes her hands.

[MSG$022F52,54]
Blood is dripping from the scratches onto the floor...

[MSG$022F95,106]
Kitami "That finalizes our contract. You've signed a contract with me. From now on, my demon-servant Rasha

[MSG$023004,26]
|will lend you his power."

[MSG$023038,66]
Kitami "He's a kind of incubus, highly skilled in the art of lust.

[MSG$02307F,64]
As a man, I'm sure you'll find a lot of use for him, won't you?"

[MSG$0230D9,38]
As she whispers, she slowly stands up.

[MSG$02310C,70]
My dick, covered in my own cum, slides out, popping out of her vagina.

[MSG$023157,63]
Now that it's been extricated, my prick is still exuding semen.

[MSG$0231A3,67]
Kitami "Looks like you were aroused big time. That makes me happy."

[MSG$023200,61]
When she stands up, a stream of cum pours out of her crevice.

[MSG$023242,48]
It drips down her thighs and pools on the floor.

[MSG$02327F,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$0232B5,90]
Kitami "The day is drawing near...I've got all the players, now all I have to do is wait."

[MSG$023329,106]
Kitami "But first of all, we need to get rid of those annoying flies...it will be a good way to kill time,

[MSG$023398,12]
at least..."

[MSG$0233BE,39]
Kitami "I'm counting on you, Minase..."

[MSG$0233FF,93]
I've finally been released from my mad pleasure, and slip into unconsciousness as she speaks.

[MSG$0234F9,18]
..................

[MSG$023518,12]
............

[MSG$023531,6]
......

[MSG$02354F,23]
Minase "I won't do it."

[MSG$023580,21]
I reject her request.

[MSG$0235A2,62]
What she's asking me to do is to basically become her servant.

[MSG$0235ED,88]
I don't know what she has in mind, but I have no desire to be at Kitami's beck and call.

[MSG$023652,92]
I can sense that it would be dangerous to believe Kitami, who just appeared out of thin air.

[MSG$0236B3,60]
I've never been able to trust her anyway, for some reason...

[MSG$0236FC,42]
Kitami "Why? Why are you turning me down?"

[MSG$023740,87]
Minase "Don't you think it's a little too much to ask me to believe a story like that?"

[MSG$0237B1,41]
Minase "I don't know anything about you."

[MSG$0237F4,24]
Kitami "Are you scared?"

[MSG$023826,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$02383F,39]
Kitami "Don't worry, you can trust me."

[MSG$023880,51]
Kitami "I'm the kind of person you need right now."

[MSG$0238CD,101]
Kitami "You've already taken a bite out of the Forbidden Fruit. Sinners like you should be in a world

[MSG$023937,14]
|for sinners."

[MSG$02395F,66]
With that, she takes a step towards me. Instinctively I step back.

[MSG$0239AE,96]
She stares right at me, and I'm overcome by a feeling that she's sucking me right into her eyes.

[MSG$023A13,32]
It's no good...I can't escape...

[MSG$023A40,72]
Kitami "Do you want to get to know me? Then I'll tell you everything..."

[MSG$023AA2,68]
After she says this, she reaches out and puts her hand on my crotch,

[MSG$023AEB,62]
massaging her way up until she's holding my prick in her hand.

[MSG$023B36,14]
Minase "Ah..."

[MSG$023B5E,51]
Kitami "Now then, let's you and I fall together..."

[MSG$023C15,17]
Minase "Stop it!"

[MSG$023CD9,59]
Suddenly I push Kitami away, freeing myself from her curse.

[MSG$023D21,59]
Minase "I'm not gonna be your slave! Go find someone else!"

[MSG$023D76,38]
I tell her this in no uncertain terms.

[MSG$023DA9,66]
The last thing I want to do is fall into hell with this professor.

[MSG$023DF0,42]
Besides, I haven't sunk to that level yet.

[MSG$023E59,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$023E72,63]
Kitami stares at me coldly, not moving a muscle the whole time.

[MSG$023EBE,47]
After a silence, Kitami speaks in a flat voice.

[MSG$023F07,60]
Her eyes are gleaming so coldly that it makes my skin crawl.

[MSG$023F50,79]
Kitami "And I had such high expectations of you...you've thrown me in despair."

[MSG$023FB9,81]
There's no longer any trace in her voice of the professor that she supposedly is.

[MSG$024017,72]
If Kitami really does possess the Dark Power, then I'm no match for her.

[MSG$024064,58]
No one knows the magnitude of that power better than me...

[MSG$0240B6,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0240CF,39]
I can't trust this professor after all.

[MSG$0240FB,38]
I ignore her and walk toward the door.

[MSG$024160,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$024179,63]
Kitami stares at me coldly, not moving a muscle the whole time.

[MSG$0241BD,81]
The moment I stretch my hand out toward the knob, she speaks out in a flat voice.

[MSG$02421B,29]
Kitami "I see...what a pity."

[MSG$024252,60]
Her eyes are gleaming so coldly that it makes my skin crawl.

[MSG$02429B,79]
Kitami "And I had such high expectations of you...you've thrown me in despair."

[MSG$024304,81]
There's no longer any trace in her voice of the professor that she supposedly is.

[MSG$024362,72]
If Kitami really does possess the Dark Power, then I'm no match for her.

[MSG$0243AF,58]
No one knows the magnitude of that power better than me...

[MSG$0243F6,72]
Kitami "But the thing is, I can always find someone to take your place."

[MSG$024458,96]
I realize that Kitami is creeping closer and closer to me. I impulsively open the Book of Magic.

[MSG$0244C5,54]
I desperately search for a spell that will protect me.

[MSG$024500,63]
But the more frantic I get, the harder it is to turn the pages.

[MSG$02454C,101]
Kitami "That won't do you any good. The spells in that book will only have a temporary effect on me."

[MSG$0245CB,59]
When I hear this, I stop turning pages and stare at Kitami.

[MSG$024613,34]
Minase "What do you want from me?"

[MSG$02464F,37]
Kitami "I've changed my mind, see..."

[MSG$02468E,77]
Kitami "I wasn't planning to kill you, but now I have the urge to abuse you."

[MSG$0246F5,30]
So saying, Kitami leers at me.

[MSG$024720,16]
Minase "(Gulps)"

[MSG$02474A,41]
I threaten her with the sword in my hand.

[MSG$024780,27]
Minase "Stay away from me!"

[MSG$0247B5,67]
Kitami is unmoved by the flickering light reflecting off the blade.

[MSG$0247FD,68]
All of a sudden, the sword doesn't seem like a lethal weapon at all.

[MSG$02484E,56]
Kitami "Don't worry, now...I'm very good at necromancy."

[MSG$0248A0,106]
Kitami "Your physical body will become a vessel that does my bidding. I'll keep you as a pet for a while."

[MSG$024924,29]
Minase "Don't screw with me!"

[MSG$02495B,31]
I wave the sword around wildly.

[MSG$024987,15]
Whoosh! Whoosh!

[MSG$0249A3,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$0249BC,73]
Kitami doesn't even flinch. She's so relaxed she has a smile on her lips.

[MSG$024A12,61]
I'm so terrified that I bring the sword down across her body.

[MSG$024AF5,6]
Clang!

[MSG$024B08,78]
But just before it hits her, it's seemingly deflected by some unseen wall, and

[MSG$024B5B,36]
plunges into the floor with a clang.

[MSG$024B8C,16]
Minase "No way!"

[MSG$024BB6,17]
Kitami "(laughs)"

[MSG$024BE1,17]
Kitami "(laughs)"

[MSG$024C0D,76]
I'm stunned. I can hear Kitami's mocking laughter echoing all over the room.

[MSG$024C66,74]
Kitami "Idiot. Did you really think you could actually hurt me, you fool?"

[MSG$024CCA,65]
Kitami "I'll just send you off to lament your stupidity in hell!"

[MSG$024D25,41]
Hearing this, I try to make a run for it.

[MSG$024D53,92]
Kitami's dead serious. Plus this woman's got the power to do exactly what she said she'd do.

[MSG$024DBC,11]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$024DD4,19]
Minase "Holy shit!"

[MSG$024E01,70]
That's when I discover that I can't move. It's like my body is frozen.

[MSG$024E4C,64]
No matter how hard I try to move forward, I don't budge an inch.

[MSG$024E99,43]
Kitami "It's no use. You can't escape now."

[MSG$024EDE,41]
With that, Kitami looks down at her feet.

[MSG$024F0C,20]
I follow her gaze...

[MSG$024F2D,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$024F45,96]
I can see my own shadow, created by the light of the candles. Kitami has planted her feet on it.

[MSG$024FAA,39]
But surely that's not why I'm immobile?

[MSG$024FDE,46]
Kitami "Now then, how should I play with you?"

[MSG$025026,53]
Kitami slowly approaches me, stepping over my shadow.

[MSG$025068,75]
Kitami "If I give you any visible bruises, it'll only be a hassle later..."

[MSG$0250CD,115]
Kitami "I've got it...why don't I be merciful and send you to the heights of ecstasy? Then you can go mad and die!"

[MSG$02515A,61]
With that, Kitami takes some kind of capsule from her pocket.

[MSG$0251A4,85]
Kitami "You're going to have an orgasm so powerful it's going to kill you. Ha ha ha!"

[MSG$025213,69]
Kitami "You're a strong boy, I'm sure the effects will be monstrous."

[MSG$025272,40]
Minase "What the hell are you gonna do?"

[MSG$0252B4,46]
She shows me the capsule in her hand in reply.

[MSG$0252EF,101]
Kitami "This is a secret potion that will teach you about lust. In other words, it's an aphrodisiac."

[MSG$02536E,102]
Kitami "It's something I concocted by blending magic and modern medicine. Its efficacy is guaranteed."

[MSG$0253EE,90]
Kitami "This is more than 10 times the normal dose. A special maximum-strength version..."

[MSG$025462,72]
Kitami "As a service to you, I'm giving you a super-concentrated dosage.

[MSG$0254AF,60]
This would drive even an elephant to madness in an instant."

[MSG$025505,62]
Minase "Are you fucking crazy? No way am I taking that thing!"

[MSG$02555D,92]
Kitami "Oh yes you are...struggle all you want, but there's nothing you can do to get away."

[MSG$02564F,85]
With that, Kitami places the capsule between her lips, then lays her mouth over mine.

[MSG$0256A9,48]
I can't move. I'm helpless against her advances.

[MSG$0256E6,16]
Kitami "Mmmm..."

[MSG$025710,20]
Minase "Mmmm! Mmmm!"

[MSG$02573E,15]
Spurt, splat...

[MSG$02575A,47]
Kitami's tongue forces its way between my lips,

[MSG$02578E,61]
and begins to shove the capsule toward the back of my throat.

[MSG$0257D8,16]
Kitami "Mmmm..."

[MSG$025802,18]
Minase "(gagging)"

[MSG$02582E,90]
Desperately I try to keep from swallowing the capsule. But Kitami's tongue is too skilful.

[MSG$02588D,32]
|Eventually she manages to force

[MSG$0258B2,72]
|the capsule, covered in both our saliva, towards the back of my throat.

[MSG$025907,7]
Gulp...

[MSG$025994,27]
Minase "Ugh...ugh...ugh..."

[MSG$0259C9,42]
Kitami withdraws her tongue from my mouth.

[MSG$0259F8,50]
A long sticky thread of saliva dangles between us.

[MSG$025A37,31]
Dammit, I swallowed that thing.

[MSG$025A63,89]
Kitami "You're history. The capsule will melt instantly. You'll just have to give it up."

[MSG$025AD6,36]
Minase "What's going to happen now?"

[MSG$025B14,66]
Kitami "Who knows? I've never used that amount on a human before."

[MSG$025B70,71]
Kitami "Don't worry, you'll find out soon enough. First-hand, that is."

[MSG$025BD1,96]
Kitami "Just for your reference, when I gave another student 1/10 the amount you just swallowed,

[MSG$025C36,79]
he couldn't stop masturbating. He just jerked off until he lost consciousness."

[MSG$025C9F,120]
Kitami "Well, let's just say that even if you do survive this, it's highly unlikely that you'll still have your sanity."

[MSG$025D31,25]
Minase "Are you serious?"

[MSG$025E04,108]
All I can do is stare dumbly at Kitami as she speaks in that calm tone of voice, a little smile on her lips.

[MSG$025E7D,13]
Minase "Ugh!"

[MSG$025EA4,52]
Soon after, I begin to feel a change inside my body.

[MSG$025EE5,57]
Kitami "It looks like the medicine's kicking in already."

[MSG$025F38,5]
Slam!

[MSG$025FA2,14]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$025FCA,46]
My body's being taken over by a massive shock.

[MSG$025FFD,49]
Lust for pleasure...it's setting my mind on fire.

[MSG$02603B,32]
Minase "Augh! (heavy breathing)"

[MSG$026075,25]
Kitami "Do you feel ill?"

[MSG$0260A8,84]
Kitami "Do you want me to help you? Or would you rather give yourself some comfort?"

[MSG$026116,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$02613E,45]
Desperately I try to fight off the sensation.

[MSG$026170,32]
But I soon realize it's useless.

[MSG$02619D,67]
No matter how hard I try to reject it, my lust only grows stronger.

[MSG$0261ED,24]
Thump...thump...thump...

[MSG$026212,65]
Every time my heart beats, I can feel the quivering in my crotch.

[MSG$026258,64]
I can't hold back anymore. If I resist any longer I'll go crazy.

[MSG$0262A5,23]
Minase "Help...help me!

[MSG$0262D6,116]
Finally I give in. I'm at the point where I don't care what happens to me anymore, as long as she satisfies my lust.

[MSG$026357,65]
Kitami "All right, I will. I'll give you some relief right away."

[MSG$02642F,56]
Kitami takes off my pants, and whips out my erect prick.

[MSG$026474,67]
Kitami "My goodness. Looks like you'll come with just one squeeze."

[MSG$0264D2,56]
Kitami "Let's see...why don't I do you with my breasts?"

[MSG$0265A0,38]
Kitami exposes her huge breasts to me.

[MSG$0265D3,48]
Kitami "All right, just stick it between these."

[MSG$0266A6,69]
I succumb to her tempting words and plunge my cock between her boobs.

[MSG$0266F8,83]
They're so big that there's still plenty of room, even after she envelops my prick.

[MSG$026758,60]
She pushes her boobs from both sides, and squeezes my prick.

[MSG$026799,69]
I can't take it. I start trying to move around in my narrow confines.

[MSG$0267EB,73]
Kitami "Impatient boy...Your prick is so hot it feels like it's on fire!"

[MSG$02684E,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$026876,93]
The juice from my prick dampens her boobs. Already I can hear squishing sounds between them..

[MSG$0268D8,101]
Kitami's boobs are surprisingly soft, and partly because of the potion, I'm ready to come in no time.

[MSG$02694A,105]
Kitami "You're about to come, aren't you? That's all right, just spray it out whenever you feel like it."

[MSG$0269CD,70]
Desperately I try to hold back, but I can't. It has a life of its own.

[MSG$026A18,57]
Kitami squeezes me even harder, stimulating me even more.

[MSG$026A5E,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$026A86,40]
Minase "I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$026AC8,37]
Kitami "Go ahead, come all you want."

[MSG$026B07,14]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$026B2F,89]
The pleasure I feel is intense as I stop grinding my hips and climax in Kitami's breasts.

[MSG$026C87,20]
Spurt! Spurt! Spurt!

[MSG$026CA8,44]
Kitami "Well! You sure are coming big time!"

[MSG$026CEE,75]
The white juice spurts out from between her huge boobs, and soils her face.

[MSG$026D3E,86]
My brain is stimulated by my intense pleasure, I'm so turned on that I know I'll faint

[MSG$026D99,39]
|if I lose focus. My whole body shakes.

[MSG$026DCD,26]
Throb...squirm...twitch...

[MSG$026DF4,107]
I continue to shoot off for a long time. The cum overflows from her cleavage and drips down onto the floor.

[MSG$026E6C,83]
Kitami "If you've got this much cum to show for it, you must've really enjoyed it!"

[MSG$026ED9,71]
Kitami "You'd better savor it while you can. This is your last time..."

[MSG$026F3A,93]
Normally, I'd be finished by now, but my prick continues to produce a massive spray of frothy

[MSG$026F9C,5]
|cum.

[MSG$026FAE,52]
This is weird...something's definitely up with this.

[MSG$026FEF,15]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$027091,24]
Spurt...spurt...spurt...

[MSG$02712F,38]
Minase "I can't stop! I can't stop..."

[MSG$02716F,43]
The pleasure still hasn't worn off, either.

[MSG$02719F,96]
It's making me feel like my brain's going to melt, and inwardly I'm screaming for it to be over.

[MSG$02720C,69]
Kitami "It's no good. It's not going to stop until your heart stops."

[MSG$02726B,114]
Kitami "Which will break down first, your brain or your heart? Not that it really makes much difference anyway..."

[MSG$0272F7,116]
Speaking calmly, Kitami pushes me away and wipes away the cum that's soiled her. She puts on her clothes and stands.

[MSG$02741A,24]
Minase "Help...help me!"

[MSG$02744C,102]
Kitami "All right, I'm going to get going now. I don't have time to watch you in this pathetic state."

[MSG$0274CC,14]
Minase "Wait!"

[MSG$0274F4,97]
Kitami "You're lucky, getting to die in a state of ecstasy. Not many people get to die so happy."

[MSG$02756F,41]
Minase "No! I don't want to die! Augh..."

[MSG$0275B2,22]
Kitami "Good night..."

[MSG$027606,9]
Squeak...

[MSG$02761C,7]
Slam...

[MSG$027630,43]
Kitami abandons me there, leaving the room.

[MSG$027660,32]
I start to lose consciousness...

[MSG$027708,30]
It's too late now for regrets.

[MSG$02772B,79]
The price to pay for underestimating the power of the Dark Arts was too high...

[MSG$027787,88]
I beg of thee, O great and merciful God, take pity on us, and forgive us for our sins...

[MSG$02780C,29]
Ending No. 5 ''Reika Kitami''

[MSG$02782E,10]
...Bad End

[MSG$02786F,70]
Kitami "But do you really think you can come back from where you are?"

[MSG$0278CF,61]
Kitami "I can always find someone else to take your place..."

[MSG$027926,96]
I realize that Kitami is creeping closer and closer to me. I impulsively open the Book of Magic.

[MSG$027993,94]
You've already taken a bite out of the Forbidden Fruit. There's a high price to pay for that."

[MSG$027A03,54]
I desperately search for a spell that will protect me.

[MSG$027A3E,63]
But the more frantic I get, the harder it is to turn the pages.

[MSG$027A8A,101]
Kitami "That won't do you any good. The spells in that book will only have a temporary effect on me."

[MSG$027B09,59]
When I hear this, I stop turning pages and stare at Kitami.

[MSG$027B51,33]
Kitami "It's time to give it up."

[MSG$027B8C,85]
I keep backing up, trying with all my might to come up with a way to get out of here.

[MSG$027BEE,66]
Kitami "It won't do you any good to try to escape. Now come here."

[MSG$027C4A,93]
Then I notice something odd; the fact that Kitami is still standing outside the magic circle.

[MSG$027CAC,63]
She's not even trying to enter...It's like she can't come in...

[MSG$027CF8,60]
That's it, she can't come in. Because of the magic circle...

[MSG$027D39,109]
Magic circles are drawn to protect magicians from evil. And I've just sanctified this particular magic circle

[MSG$027DAB,8]
|myself.

[MSG$027DC0,100]
It probably wouldn't have any effect on a normal person, but if Kitami is affiliated with the devil,

[MSG$027E29,52]
then the effects of the magic circle should kick in.

[MSG$027E6A,80]
In other words, as long as I stay inside the circle she can't do anything to me.

[MSG$027F4A,37]
Minase "I get it, so that's it, huh?"

[MSG$027F89,56]
Kitami "What's the matter, have you decided to give in?"

[MSG$027FDB,36]
Minase "No, the opposite, actually."

[MSG$028019,47]
Minase "You can't step into this magic circle."

[MSG$028062,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$02807B,49]
Minase "Hey, what do you have to say about that?"

[MSG$0280C6,45]
Minase "Come on, try coming into the circle."

[MSG$02810D,45]
Slowly, she stretches her hand out toward me.

[MSG$02825C,7]
Thwack!

[MSG$028270,16]
Kitami "Damn..."

[MSG$02829A,92]
The instant she tried to put her hand over the line of magic circle, something deflected it.

[MSG$0282FB,26]
So it's working after all.

[MSG$028322,57]
Minase "Just as I thought...you can't enter this circle."

[MSG$028375,12]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$02838E,50]
Minase "You might have all the power in the world,

[MSG$0283C5,72]
but a simple circle drawn on the floor can render you totally helpless."

[MSG$028427,29]
I sneer at her as I say this.

[MSG$028449,75]
As long as I stay inside the circle, at least she won't be able to hurt me.

[MSG$0284A1,42]
Kitami "I wouldn't be too sure of that..."

[MSG$0284E5,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$02850C,68]
Kitami "Do you really think you can resist me in that magic circle?"

[MSG$02856A,104]
Kitami "Don't forget, during ritual 12 years ago, this magic circle was too weak to escape the power..."

[MSG$0285EC,52]
With that, she reaches out her hand toward me again.

[MSG$028742,17]
Whack! Crackle...

[MSG$028760,64]
Her hand touches the barrier field, and bluish-white sparks fly.

[MSG$0287AD,30]
Kitami "OKTNS ITRPS TUER OILIF

[MSG$0287D0,19]
|TUER IRTAP EYROLG"

[MSG$0287FD,54]
As Kitami chants, the barrier field begins to flicker.

[MSG$028840,15]
Minase "What?!"

[MSG$028869,77]
Kitami's hand continues to consume the barrier field, pushing its way inside.

[MSG$0288BB,64]
It's just a matter of time before the barrier field is breached.

[MSG$028908,66]
Kitami "So do you still believe in the power of the magic circle?"

[MSG$028964,14]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$02898C,89]
I've got to escape...if the barrier field's breached, I won't have any protection at all.

[MSG$0289EA,30]
I don't have time to hesitate.

[MSG$028A15,23]
Minase "Out of my way!"

[MSG$028A46,72]
As I shout, I throw the Book of Magic in Kitami's face as hard as I can.

[MSG$028A9B,6]
Crash!

[MSG$028AAE,87]
The book is considerably heavy. I can hear a rush of wind as it flies towards her face.

[MSG$028B0A,51]
In the next instant, I make a rush toward the door.

[MSG$028BE2,5]
Slam!

[MSG$028BF4,13]
Kitami "Ugh!"

[MSG$028C98,41]
The book hits Kitami's face with a thump.

[MSG$028CC6,100]
She strikes it away with her hand, but the shock of the impact makes her off balance for an instant.

[MSG$028D37,82]
Ignoring her, I kick the door open, race up the stairs and burst into the hallway.

[MSG$028E14,5]
Slam!

[MSG$028E26,87]
I close the door right away. I gulp air as though I'm trying to calm down my breathing.

[MSG$028E8A,30]
Minase "Gasp...gasp...gasp..."

[MSG$028EC2,77]
Kitami isn't chasing me. There are a few students in the hall, staring at me.

[MSG$028F24,69]
Somehow I managed to escape. But is Kitami really going to let me go?

[MSG$028F76,104]
I know that would be too good to be true, but even Kitami wouldn't attack me in front of other people...

[MSG$02901D,50]
Saeki "What are you doing...in a place like this?"

[MSG$029069,65]
Saeki sees me standing their catching my breath as she passes by.

[MSG$0290AF,38]
What's she still doing here at school?

[MSG$0290E2,31]
Minase "Nothing, it's nothing."

[MSG$02911B,83]
Saeki "Are you all right? You look pale. Why don't you go to the campus infirmary?"

[MSG$029188,31]
I was going to go there anyway.

[MSG$0291B4,32]
Minase "It's nothing, I'm fine."

[MSG$0291EE,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$029206,111]
With that, I head toward the infirmary where Imari is sleeping. My footsteps are heavy as I walk down the hall.

[MSG$029282,15]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$029310,10]
Door opens

[MSG$029327,52]
I return to the infirmary and check on Imari in bed.

[MSG$0293E4,20]
Imari "Zzz...zzz..."

[MSG$029412,21]
Imari's still asleep.

[MSG$029434,20]
Imari "Zzz...zzz..."

[MSG$029462,55]
I stare at Imari as she lies there sleeping peacefully.

[MSG$02949E,52]
The sight of her sleeping face puts my mind at ease.

[MSG$0294DF,27]
I shouldn't stay here long.

[MSG$029507,113]
Right now I need to avoid that crazy professor as much as possible. I'd better wake Imari up and get out of here.

[MSG$029585,30]
Minase "Imari...hey, wake up!"

[MSG$0295BD,25]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$0295E3,14]
I shake Imari.

[MSG$0295FE,14]
Imari "Mmm..."

[MSG$029626,57]
Imari twists her body and starts to regain consciousness.

[MSG$029664,60]
I can't believe she can sleep so deeply after what happened.

[MSG$0296AD,20]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$0296DB,21]
Imari "Huh...Minase?"

[MSG$029786,10]
Getting up

[MSG$02979D,22]
Imari slowly wakes up.

[MSG$0297C0,45]
Imari "Mmm...huh? Hey, what am I doing here?"

[MSG$029807,35]
She rubs her eyes and looks around.

[MSG$029837,7]
Whoa...

[MSG$02984B,32]
Imari's not wearing any clothes.

[MSG$029870,36]
Her underwear is blindingly white...

[MSG$0298A1,79]
Imari "Wait, now I remember! That jerk Shinjou or whatever his name was, he..."

[MSG$02990A,83]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$029977,75]
Imari's trembling from rage as she remembers what went down on the rooftop.

[MSG$0299CF,87]
It looks like she doesn't remember anything that happened after she lost consciousness.

[MSG$029A2B,88]
I'm glad, because it would complicate things if she remembered what happened in the gym.

[MSG$029A90,65]
Imari "Oh, no, look at the time! The club meeting's over by now!"

[MSG$029AEB,53]
Imari "Huh? What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?"

[MSG$029B3A,53]
Imari notices that I'm staring at her and looks down.

[MSG$029B7C,16]
Minase "That..."

[MSG$029BA6,23]
I point to Imari's bra.

[MSG$029BCA,12]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$029BF0,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$029C08,48]
Imari looks down at her body for the first time.

[MSG$029CC2,47]
Imari "Augh! Don't look at me! Why am I naked?"

[MSG$029D0B,24]
Imari "Don't tell me..."

[MSG$029D3D,19]
Imari stares at me.

[MSG$029D55,22]
As if I'm the culprit.

[MSG$029D78,49]
Minase "It wasn't me! That's a false accusation!"

[MSG$029DC3,34]
Imari "I don't know about that..."

[MSG$029DFF,26]
I'm being wrongly accused.

[MSG$029E1E,80]
Anyway, Kitami didn't have to take off all her clothes. Was she just being mean?

[MSG$029E7B,67]
Imari "Stop staring at me, already! Turn around for heaven's sake!"

[MSG$029ED8,5]
Snap!

[MSG$029EEA,34]
I hurriedly turn my back on Imari.

[MSG$029F19,21]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$02A01D,5]
Click

[MSG$02A02F,18]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$02A05B,40]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$02A090,75]
Imari had vented her anger against Inoue and his gang all the way home, but

[MSG$02A0E0,70]
I barely heard her, only giving her vague responses from time to time.

[MSG$02A133,51]
Right now, I don't have time to listen to her rant.

[MSG$02A1EF,38]
I sit down at my desk and open my bag.

[MSG$02A21A,39]
The Book of Magic is no longer there...

[MSG$02A24E,36]
I'd thrown it against Kitami's face.

[MSG$02A277,89]
I have some regrets about losing that book. But there was nothing else I could've done...

[MSG$02A2DD,73]
Besides, that book would only hinder me if I tried to escape from Kitami.

[MSG$02A32B,100]
Now I have no connection to the basement room. As time goes on, I bet Kitami will forget about me...

[MSG$02A39C,16]
Minase "(yawns)"

[MSG$02A3C6,27]
I'm really wiped out today.

[MSG$02A3E6,57]
If I get into bed, I'll fall asleep within three seconds.

[MSG$02A42C,29]
You can't blame me, really...

[MSG$02A44E,30]
Too much happened to me today.

[MSG$02A479,49]
I get up from my chair and tear off my clothes...

[MSG$02A4AF,84]
I leave my sister a note, telling her I don't need dinner, and then I dive into bed.

[MSG$02A510,51]
Minase "I can't tell what's true and what's not..."

[MSG$02A55D,26]
I remember Kitami's words.

[MSG$02A57C,66]
Kitami...a demon-master who took part in that ritual 12 years ago.

[MSG$02A5CB,106]
But can that be true? It's odd that she's the only one who survived. And if you go by what Kitami told me,

[MSG$02A63A,27]
the story doesn't add up...

[MSG$02A662,48]
But pondering all this won't get me any answers.

[MSG$02A697,86]
I have too much to think about. I don't even know what I have to straighten out first.

[MSG$02A6FA,52]
I soon as I lose concentration, I sink into sleep...

[MSG$02A7B6,18]
..................

[MSG$02A7D5,12]

[MSG$02A7EE,6]

[MSG$02A808,15]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$02A81A,18]
Voice "Wake up..."

[MSG$02A846,32]
Voice "Come on, I said wake up!"

[MSG$02A880,25]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$02A936,15]
Minase "Mmm..."

[MSG$02A95F,61]
Imari "So you're not going to get up, eh? All right, then..."

[MSG$02A9B6,65]
I hear her rustling around, then she places something in my ears.

[MSG$02AA04,15]
Imari "Sss...."

[MSG$02AA2D,25]
Imari "Wake the heck up!"

[MSG$02AA60,14]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$02AA88,28]
Instantly I jump out of bed.

[MSG$02AAA9,92]
I've got a stethoscope against my ears, and Imari's holding the end of it like a microphone.

[MSG$02ABB1,60]
Imari "Come on, how long is it going to take you to get up?"

[MSG$02AC07,23]
Minase "Is it morning?"

[MSG$02AC38,54]
I yawn as I ask Imari this. She's standing next to me.

[MSG$02AC7B,39]
Imari "Are you still dreaming or what?"

[MSG$02ACBC,39]
True, this doesn't look like my room...

[MSG$02ACF0,22]
And I'm in my uniform.

[MSG$02AD0B,37]
There's a faint hospital smell, too..

[MSG$02AD35,29]
Is this the school infirmary?

[MSG$02AD5F,97]
Imari "There's nothing strange about me being asleep here, but why were you sleeping next to me?"

[MSG$02ADDA,13]
I wonder why?

[MSG$02ADEC,95]
I remember getting roughed up by Inoue and the gang on the roof. Then I went to the basement...

[MSG$02AE50,29]
And after that, I remember...

[MSG$02AE7A,73]
Imari "What time do you think it is? The club meeting ended a while ago."

[MSG$02AEDD,59]
I glance at my watch and see that it's the end of the day..

[MSG$02AF1D,56]
A lot of time has gone by since I was in the basement...

[MSG$02AF62,11]
Basement...

[MSG$02AF7A,43]
That's right...I was in the basement and...

[MSG$02AFB2,22]
I remember everything,

[MSG$02AFCD,32]
What happened in the basement...

[MSG$02AFF5,15]
Kitami and I...

[MSG$02B009,29]
Could that have been a dream?

[MSG$02B033,44]
Imari "What's the matter? You look so lost."

[MSG$02B079,31]
Minase "Huh? Oh, it's nothing."

[MSG$02B0B2,32]
Minase "Listen, where's Kitami?"

[MSG$02B0EC,60]
Imari "How should I know? Nobody was around when I woke up."

[MSG$02B142,14]
Minase "Oh..."

[MSG$02B16A,45]
I don't know how long I've been here, either.

[MSG$02B19C,41]
It feels like it all happened in a dream.

[MSG$02B1D2,65]
Imari "Anyway, let's go home. Or else the gate will close on us."

[MSG$02B22D,30]
Minase "Yeah, you're right..."

[MSG$02B265,55]
I give up trying to figure it out, and get up from bed.

[MSG$02B2A9,27]
Minase "Are you all right?"

[MSG$02B2DE,52]
I ask Imari this as I extricate myself from the bed.

[MSG$02B31F,45]
Imari "Yes, I slept soundly so I'm fine now."

[MSG$02B398,83]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$02B405,52]
Imari's totally unfazed, as if nothing had happened.

[MSG$02B43E,68]
She's just her usual self. I can't believe how thick-skinned she is.

[MSG$02B4B3,7]
Thud...

[MSG$02B4C7,64]
As soon as my feet hit the ground, something falls to the floor.

[MSG$02B514,49]
I look and it's something wrapped in white cloth.

[MSG$02B552,20]
The Book of Magic...

[MSG$02B56B,66]
I pick it up in a hurry. I don't remember bringing that with me...

[MSG$02B5BA,41]
When I stand up, I'm overcome by fatigue.

[MSG$02B5E8,26]
My body feels super-heavy.

[MSG$02B641,21]
Imari "What's wrong?"

[MSG$02B670,22]
Minase "It's nothing."

[MSG$02B6A0,33]
I shake my head to get rid of it.

[MSG$02B6CE,17]
My stomach hurts.

[MSG$02B6E4,36]
I touch it and it tingles painfully.

[MSG$02B70D,34]
I pull up my shirt to have a look.

[MSG$02B73C,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$02B754,38]
There's a bloody triangle on my shirt.

[MSG$02B77F,47]
It's like a diagram drawn in blood on my shirt.

[MSG$02B7BB,29]
The symbol of the contract...

[MSG$02B7DD,28]
It was Kitami who drew it...

[MSG$02B806,69]
In that case, everything that happened in that basement was for real.

[MSG$02B850,32]
I quickly conceal it from Imari.

[MSG$02B87D,17]
Imari "Let's go."

[MSG$02B8A8,69]
I pick up the cloth-wrapped book, and leave the infirmary with Imari.

[MSG$02B8FA,21]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$02B9FE,5]
Click

[MSG$02BA10,18]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$02BA3C,40]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$02BA71,79]
Imari had vented all her anger against Inoue and his gang all the way home, but

[MSG$02BAC5,70]
I barely heard her, only giving her vague responses from time to time.

[MSG$02BB18,51]
Right now, I don't have time to listen to her rant.

[MSG$02BBD4,38]
I sit down at my desk and open my bag.

[MSG$02BBFF,51]
I take out the Book of Magic and set it on my desk.

[MSG$02BC3F,80]
I remember bringing this down to the basement. And then I had sex with Kitami...

[MSG$02BC9C,79]
When I close my eyes, it comes back to me. My body still remembers how it felt.

[MSG$02BCF8,16]
Minase "(yawns)"

[MSG$02BD22,27]
I'm really wiped out today.

[MSG$02BD42,57]
If I get into bed, I'll fall asleep within three seconds.

[MSG$02BD88,29]
You can't blame me, really...

[MSG$02BDB2,41]
Not after what happened in that basement.

[MSG$02BDE8,47]
I get up from my chair and tear off my clothes.

[MSG$02BE24,84]
I leave my sister a note, telling her I don't need dinner, and then I dive into bed.

[MSG$02BE85,51]
Minase "I can't tell what's true and what's not..."

[MSG$02BED2,26]
I remember Kitami's words.

[MSG$02BEF1,66]
Kitami...a demon-master who took part in that ritual 12 years ago.

[MSG$02BF40,106]
But can that be true? It's odd that she's the only one who survived. And if you go by what Kitami told me,

[MSG$02BFAF,27]
the story doesn't add up...

[MSG$02BFD7,48]
But pondering all this won't get me any answers.

[MSG$02C00C,85]
I have too much to think about. I don't even know what I should straighten out first.

[MSG$02C06E,52]
I soon as I lose concentration, I sink into sleep...
