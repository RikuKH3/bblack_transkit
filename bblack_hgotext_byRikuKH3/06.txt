[MSG$0007D5,28]
Amatsuki "I-I'm a virgin..."

[MSG$00080B,78]
When I try to penetrate Amatsuki, she blurts this out in an embarrassed voice.

[MSG$000866,39]
Minase "Then I'll fix that right away."

[MSG$0008A7,23]
Amatsuki "All right..."

[MSG$0008D8,93]
I make sure Amatsuki nods in agreement, then put my stiff, erect prick up against her crotch.

[MSG$000942,16]
Amatsuki "Ah..."

[MSG$00096C,97]
I push the head of my penis against her crevice, then thrust from my hips in one sudden movement.

[MSG$000ADE,16]
Amatsuki "Augh!"

[MSG$000B08,26]
My penis slides in easily.

[MSG$000B27,59]
It goes in so smoothly I can't believe it's her first time.

[MSG$000B6F,89]
Amatsuki seems a little confused by the introduction of a foreign object into her vagina.

[MSG$000BCD,61]
But thanks to the spell, she doesn't seem to be in much pain.

[MSG$000C17,23]
I start moving my hips.

[MSG$000C3B,19]
Amatsuki "Ooooh..."

[MSG$000C68,39]
Amatsuki shivers at this new sensation.

[MSG$000C9C,42]
Her vagina constricts my dick mercilessly.

[MSG$000CD3,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$000CFB,57]
The pleasure is intense, and I keep thrusting in ecstasy.

[MSG$000D39,120]
It seems as though she's feeling it too, because almost imperceptibly she begins to move her own hips in sync with mine.

[MSG$000DBE,60]
Amatsuki "Even though it's my first time, it feels so good!"

[MSG$000E14,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$000E3C,30]
Amatsuki "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$000E74,87]
Amatsuki rubs up against Kurimoto's crotch, churning her hips and continuing to writhe.

[MSG$000ED8,40]
Kurimoto "Jun! Hey, don't rub me there."

[MSG$000F1B,56]
Amatsuki "Oh, come on...I couldn't stop if I wanted to!"

[MSG$000F6D,60]
Amatsuki and I continue to feed our lust, ignoring Kurimoto.

[MSG$000FB6,46]
Minase "This is awesome...I'm gonna come now."

[MSG$000FFE,37]
Amatsuki "Me, too! It feels so good!"

[MSG$00103D,64]
Amatsuki "Even though it's my first time...it feels so amazing!"

[MSG$001097,46]
Minase "Yeah...I can't hold it in any longer!"

[MSG$0010E0,93]
I'm overcome with the urge to ejaculate. At this rate, I'm sure I can shoot off indefinitely.

[MSG$00114A,35]
Amatsuki "I'm coming...I'm coming!"

[MSG$001187,80]
At the same time that I'm increasing the speed of my thrusts, Amatsuki climaxes.

[MSG$0011DC,39]
Realizing this, I get ready to explode.

[MSG$001210,28]
Minase "I'm gonna come now!"

[MSG$001246,38]
Amatsuki "Let it out! Come inside me!"

[MSG$001286,19]
Minase "Here goes!"

[MSG$0012B3,57]
I do as she requests and thrust myself deeper inside her.

[MSG$0012F1,56]
My cock slams up against the deepest part of her vagina.

[MSG$001336,18]
Amatsuki "Ahhhhh!"

[MSG$001362,52]
I aim for her womb and let out a spurt of hot semen.

[MSG$001520,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$001546,64]
Amatsuki "I can feel it in me! I can feel you coming inside me!"

[MSG$0015A0,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$0015C0,84]
I'm coming so hard that there's some frothy white juice leaking out from the cracks.

[MSG$001621,76]
When I've released all my semen inside her womb, I slowly withdraw my prick.

[MSG$00177E,19]
Amatsuki "Ahhhh..."

[MSG$0017AB,57]
She lets out a heavy sigh, then flops over in exhaustion.

[MSG$0017F1,82]
My semen starts to flow out of her vagina audibly, and runs down toward the floor.

[MSG$001848,64]
There's so much that it coats Kurimoto's body on its way down...

[MSG$001895,101]
Even though I've just expelled a massive amount of cum, my dick's already sticking straight up again.

[MSG$0018FF,59]
I can still keep going...at this rate, I can go on forever.

[MSG$001AA1,30]
Kurimoto "Hurry up, will you?"

[MSG$001AD9,79]
I push my prick towards Kurimoto, and she twists her hips as if she can't wait.

[MSG$001B35,26]
Minase "You little bitch."

[MSG$001B69,71]
I look down at her acting like a wild animal in heat, and ridicule her.

[MSG$001BBD,80]
Kurimoto "Call me whatever you want! All I can think of is your cock inside me!"

[MSG$001C27,63]
Hearing this, I shove my stiff, erect prick against her crotch.

[MSG$001C73,18]
Squish...squish...

[MSG$001C92,77]
And then to tease her, I start dabbing Kurimoto's oozing juice onto my penis.

[MSG$001CEC,74]
Kurimoto "Hurry...hurry the hell up! Stick that penis of yours inside me!"

[MSG$001D50,84]
Kurimoto starts pleading with me, apparently not being able to take the frustration.

[MSG$001DA9,105]
When I see the boyish and assertive Kurimoto reduced to begging, I get so aroused I can barely hold back.

[MSG$001E1F,92]
Finally I reach my limit, and I press my prick against her crevice. Then I plunge it inside.

[MSG$001E88,8]
Slide...

[MSG$001FA1,16]
Kurimoto "Ahhh!"

[MSG$001FCB,85]
Probably because she's already all wet, my prick slides effortlessly into her vagina.

[MSG$002025,90]
I shove it in all the way, and a torrent of juice leaks out from the slit around my penis.

[MSG$00208C,53]
Kurimoto "Ohhh...you've got such a big dick, Minase."

[MSG$0020DB,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$002103,77]
I explore Kurimoto's insides, then slowly start to thrust my hips inside her.

[MSG$00215D,50]
She's in great shape, so her vagina's a tight fit.

[MSG$00219C,16]
Kurimoto "Ohhh!"

[MSG$0021C6,61]
Kurimoto "Well...so how is it? Does it feel good down there?"

[MSG$00221D,99]
Minase "You've got to tighten up some more. Right now you're so loose it doesn't feel good at all."

[MSG$00229A,61]
I lie to her because I want to bully her for being so cheeky.

[MSG$0022E4,75]
Kurimoto "Oh, come on, that can't be true! I don't even use it that often."

[MSG$002349,88]
Kurimoto has a look of confusion on her face as she clenches her vagina and tightens up.

[MSG$0023AE,15]
Minase "Ahh..."

[MSG$0023D7,81]
Kurimoto's as strong as a goddamned ox. She's squeezing the life out of my penis.

[MSG$00242D,64]
Even so, I'm able to move around inside thanks to all her juice.

[MSG$00247A,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$0024A2,77]
Every time I thrust, the juice leaks out from between my prick and her labia.

[MSG$0024FC,91]
Every time I move, it feels like my prick's getting strangled, and I get a shot of pleasure

[MSG$00255C,31]
|so intense my mind goes blank.

[MSG$002588,36]
Minase "Ohh...this is so awesome..."

[MSG$0025C6,86]
Kurimoto "I'm so glad...I want you to get off, because I'm getting off right now too!"

[MSG$002636,57]
With that, Kurimoto frantically starts churning her hips.

[MSG$00267C,14]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$0026A4,81]
Thanks to all the squeezing and the friction, I'm ready for an orgasm in no time.

[MSG$002702,24]
Minase "I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$002734,42]
Kurimoto "Together...let's come together!"

[MSG$002778,47]
Kurimoto "But not inside me! Come all over me!"

[MSG$0027C1,24]
Minase "I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$0027F3,22]
Kurimoto "I'm coming!"

[MSG$002823,6]
Splat!

[MSG$002836,58]
I do as she asks and whip out my prick just as I'm coming.

[MSG$0029FA,15]
Spurting noises

[MSG$002A16,17]
Amatsuki "Aaaah!"

[MSG$002A41,58]
As soon as I pull out, I let loose a massive spray of cum.

[MSG$002A88,20]
Splat, splat, splat!

[MSG$002AA9,80]
Huge amounts of semen starts raining down on Amatsuki, who's on top of Kurimoto.

[MSG$002AFE,53]
The frothy white juice soils her stomach and breasts.

[MSG$002C44,28]
Amatsuki "Hot! It's so hot!"

[MSG$002C7A,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$002CB0,58]
I finish ejaculating and gaze at Amatsuki's dripping body.

[MSG$002CF7,40]
But my prick is still as hard as before.

[MSG$002D24,36]
I still have some more to let out...

[MSG$002EF0,18]
April 25 - Morning

[MSG$002FCE,15]
Minase "Mmm..."

[MSG$002FF7,19]
I roll over in bed.

[MSG$00300F,69]
I exit the land of slumber and swiftly return to the land of reality.

[MSG$003059,23]
Slowly, I open my eyes.

[MSG$00310D,10]
Silence...

[MSG$003124,50]
I don't hear Imari's voice. Or see her anywhere...

[MSG$003183,22]
Minase "Good night..."

[MSG$00322C,24]
........................

[MSG$003251,27]
...........................

[MSG$003279,6]
Ugh...

[MSG$0032AF,27]
...........................

[MSG$0032D7,6]
Ugh...

[MSG$00330D,27]
...........................

[MSG$003335,6]
Ugh...

[MSG$00336B,27]
...........................

[MSG$00340B,19]
Throws back blanket

[MSG$00342B,29]
Minase "Shit! I can't sleep."

[MSG$003463,66]
I have no choice but to shove aside my blanket and get out of bed.

[MSG$0034BD,35]
Impossible. Me waking up on my own?

[MSG$0034E5,36]
Imari's got to be somewhere, hiding.

[MSG$003516,15]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$00353F,10]
Silence...

[MSG$003556,41]
I call out to her, but there's no answer.

[MSG$00358C,21]
I peer under the bed.

[MSG$0035AE,15]
Minase "Imari?"

[MSG$0035D7,15]
She's not here.

[MSG$0035F3,6]
Click.

[MSG$003606,28]
Next I open the closet door.

[MSG$00362F,15]
Minase "Imari?"

[MSG$003658,28]
She's nowhere to be found...

[MSG$003681,38]
I'm impressed that I got up on my own.

[MSG$0036AC,93]
That only happens once a year or so. I shouldn't use up all my luck on something like this...

[MSG$003716,43]
I bet it's going to rain today as a result!

[MSG$003746,49]
But when I look out the window, it's not raining.

[MSG$003784,43]
I rub my drowsy eyes and look at the clock.

[MSG$0037BC,30]
It's only a little after 7 AM.

[MSG$0037DF,52]
I've got more than 30 minutes before Imari shows up.

[MSG$003820,77]
I add up the number of hours I slept, and I can see why I was able to get up.

[MSG$00387A,50]
That's right, I went to bed as soon as I got home.

[MSG$0038B9,110]
No matter how you look at it, I've slept for more than 12 hours. That's way more than the recommended minimum.

[MSG$00392C,98]
So it's neither surprising that I was able to get up on my own, nor is it something to crow about.

[MSG$00399B,16]
Minase "(yawns)"

[MSG$0039C5,19]
I stretch and yawn.

[MSG$0039E5,74]
Since I'm up, I might as well get ready for the day before Imari shows up.

[MSG$003A34,42]
I shed my pajamas and get into my uniform.

[MSG$003AE7,8]
Click...

[MSG$003B2F,55]
Yukiko "What the heck? What are you doing up so early?"

[MSG$003B80,86]
When I step out into the hall, my sister, who's just gotten up herself, is walking by.

[MSG$003BE3,104]
She's practically naked. She's strolling around the house without even trying to hide her private parts.

[MSG$003C58,17]
Goddam flasher...

[MSG$003C6E,113]
Just because she doesn't have a guy to strip in front of doesn't mean she has to walk around the house like that.

[MSG$003CEC,67]
Minase "So what if I am? You got a problem with me being up early?"

[MSG$003D49,90]
Yukiko "It's a miracle to see your face right after you've woken up. Really, I'm stunned."

[MSG$003DBD,76]
Yukiko "This is so unusual, it's not going to just rain, it's going to snow!

[MSG$003E0E,49]
Actually, the Lord of Terror might even descend!"

[MSG$003E59,61]
That's really harsh...Oh, well, I guess it IS pretty unusual.

[MSG$003EA3,84]
But look at her! Her underwear's totally exposed, and her boobs are about to pop out

[MSG$003EFC,19]
|from her tank top.

[MSG$003F1C,90]
Actually, they are hanging out. And she's not wearing a bra, so you can see the outline of

[MSG$003F7B,15]
|her nipples...

[MSG$003F97,113]
She's being too liberal even for inside the house. If she wasn't my sister you couldn't blame for jumping on her.

[MSG$004015,46]
Yukiko "Hey, what are you looking at, pervert?

[MSG$00405D,61]
Yukiko "Don't tell me you're getting off looking at my body!"

[MSG$0040B4,23]
Minase "Gimme a break!"

[MSG$0040E5,20]
Yukiko "Now, now..."

[MSG$004113,108]
Yukiko "Hey, since you're my kid brother, I'll give you the privilege of touching my breasts. Come on, now!"

[MSG$004199,57]
With that, Yukiko thrusts her massive boobs closer to me.

[MSG$0041FB,18]
Minase "You twit!"

[MSG$004227,41]
With that, I bat her boobs out of my way.

[MSG$004255,24]
Her huge breasts quiver.

[MSG$00427A,14]
Yukiko "Augh!"

[MSG$004337,6]
Smack!

[MSG$00434A,48]
Yukiko "Who said you could touch them for real?"

[MSG$004394,56]
Turning bright red, my sister whacks me across the face.

[MSG$0043D9,26]
She's the one who offered!

[MSG$004400,62]
Yukiko "You'll have to beg for ten years to touch my breasts!"

[MSG$004458,62]
Minase "It's not like I wanted to touch those sagging things!"

[MSG$0044B0,27]
Yukiko "What did you say?!"

[MSG$00457E,5]
Slug!

[MSG$004590,74]
As she yells, my sister draws back her foot and kicks me between the legs.

[MSG$0045E7,42]
Her nails land right on my precious balls.

[MSG$00461E,14]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$004646,20]
April 25 - Your Room

[MSG$0046D5,4]
Thud

[MSG$0046E6,21]
Minase "Ugh...ugh..."

[MSG$004715,64]
I fall onto my bed, clutching my balls as I roll around in pain.

[MSG$00475A,85]
After I've rolled around for a long time, I'm finally released from the hellish pain.

[MSG$0047BC,37]
Minase "Ugh...felt like I was dying."

[MSG$0047FB,45]
I wipe the sweat from my forehead and sit up.

[MSG$004835,107]
I was so overcome with pain that I'd forgotten all about it. It's almost time for Imari to come wake me up.

[MSG$0048AD,12]
Ding-dong...

[MSG$0048C6,29]
Just then the doorbell rings.

[MSG$0048F6,48]
I stare at Yukiko's boobs, thrust under my nose.

[MSG$00492B,41]
I can feel my crotch stirring a little...

[MSG$004961,23]
"I want to rape her..."

[MSG$0049A7,5]
Huh?!

[MSG$0049B9,99]
I hear the voice inside my head, and before I know it my hand is reaching out to touch her breasts.

[MSG$004AA5,7]
Squeeze

[MSG$004AB9,24]
Yukiko "Hey...hey, you!"

[MSG$004AEB,39]
My hands squeeze her boobs mercilessly.

[MSG$004B17,35]
I begin to massage them skillfully.

[MSG$004B47,67]
While I'm doing this, my fingertips start playing with her nipples.

[MSG$004B97,24]
Yukiko "Hey, stop that!"

[MSG$004BC9,82]
Yukiko turns red as her body begins to quiver in response to my skillful nuzzling.

[MSG$004C20,41]
I can feel her nipples stand up straight.

[MSG$004C56,41]
I forget myself as I continue my assault.

[MSG$004C8C,106]
For a moment she gives in, but then suddenly she snaps out of it and shoves me away, pushing away my hand.

[MSG$004D03,71]
Yukiko "Stop it, I said! I don't care if it's a joke, I won't have it!"

[MSG$004E04,62]
Yukiko "If you do that again you'll wish you were never born!"

[MSG$004E5C,60]
With that, she retreats to her own room, her face still red.

[MSG$004EC9,35]
Minase "What do I think I'm doing?"

[MSG$004F06,44]
I stand there in a daze, staring at my hand.

[MSG$004F3F,51]
I'd forgotten myself and massaged Yukiko's breasts.

[MSG$004F7F,59]
Something's wrong with me...I looked upon Yukiko with lust.

[MSG$004FBF,52]
As if I were being manipulated by an unseen force...

[MSG$005000,82]
I can still see Yukiko's outraged face. Normally she lets everything go as a joke,

[MSG$005057,38]
but this time she was truly disturbed.

[MSG$005082,21]
I should apologize...

[MSG$0050A4,47]
I head toward her room to apologize right away.

[MSG$0050D8,57]
I stand in front of her door and put my hand on the knob.

[MSG$00511E,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$005136,49]
I stop myself just as I'm about to open the door.

[MSG$00517C,18]
Yukiko "(moaning)"

[MSG$0051A8,50]
I can hear Yukiko's voice faintly beyond the door.

[MSG$0051E7,55]
Yukiko "Oh...ahhh! This is amazing! Look how wet I am!"

[MSG$005238,16]
This can't be...

[MSG$00524D,36]
Her voice just doesn't sound normal.

[MSG$00527E,60]
I open the door silently, just a crack so I can peek inside.

[MSG$005369,16]
Yukiko "Aaaaah!"

[MSG$005393,70]
Through the crack in the door, I can hear Yukiko moaning with ecstasy.

[MSG$0053DE,76]
She's so wrapped up in what she's doing that she doesn't notice me watching.

[MSG$005437,78]
I see her writhing all over her bed, thrusting her own hands between her legs.

[MSG$00548A,40]
I've never seen her masturbate before...

[MSG$0054BF,74]
Yukiko "I can't believe I'm so aroused just from being touched like that!"

[MSG$00550E,6]
Ahhh!"

[MSG$00552E,82]
Her face is a mixture of confusion and ecstasy as she relentlessly pumps her hands

[MSG$005585,20]
|inside her panties.

[MSG$0055A6,41]
Yukiko "This isn't enough to satisfy me!"

[MSG$0055E9,42]
With that, she discards her soggy panties.

[MSG$005618,46]
They're sopping wet, so they stick to her leg.

[MSG$005653,105]
Then she sticks her hand between the bed and the mattress, and withdraws something with a round blue tip.

[MSG$0056C1,45]
It's a vibrator...I had no idea she used one.

[MSG$005784,83]
She turns it on and it begins to whir and vibrate. She holds it against her crotch,

[MSG$0057DC,52]
adjusts the dial, and cranks it up to maximum speed.

[MSG$00581D,14]
Yukiko "Ahhh!"

[MSG$005845,45]
Instantly she lets out a whimper of pleasure.

[MSG$005877,41]
She applies the vibrator to her clitoris.

[MSG$0058AD,18]
Yukiko "(moaning)"

[MSG$0058D9,70]
It must really feel good, because she leaves it there for a long time.

[MSG$005924,60]
She has a look of dazed pleasure on her face the whole time.

[MSG$00596D,26]
Yukiko "Back here, too..."

[MSG$0059A1,115]
She whispers this and turns off the vibrator. Then she removes it from her vagina, and presses it against her anus.

[MSG$005A19,47]
Don't tell me she's going to use it there, too!

[MSG$005ACE,14]
Yukiko "Ahhh!"

[MSG$005AF6,68]
She places her finger against the vibrator and shoves it up her ass.

[MSG$005B47,43]
The blue object is pressed up into her ass.

[MSG$005B7F,93]
When it's halfway up her ass, she stops pushing. Fondling herself in the vagina, she turns on

[MSG$005BE1,12]
|the switch.

[MSG$005BFA,15]
Yukiko "Ahhhh!"

[MSG$005C23,66]
She writhes in crazed ecstasy as she treats herself on both sides.

[MSG$005C6A,61]
I had no idea my sister engaged in masturbation this intense.

[MSG$005CB4,67]
Yukiko "Awesome! I can't hold it anymore! I can't hold it anymore!"

[MSG$005D11,32]
Yukiko "I'm coming! I'm coming!"

[MSG$005D4B,82]
Unaware that I'm observing all this, she lets out a shriek as she tries to climax.

[MSG$005DAA,44]
Yukiko "I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!"

[MSG$005DF0,19]
Yukiko "(grunting)"

[MSG$005EA6,56]
With a muffled shriek, my sister quivers as she orgasms.

[MSG$005EEB,20]
Splat, splat, splat!

[MSG$005F0C,77]
As she climaxes, she expels a vigorous stream of juice from between her legs.

[MSG$005F5E,64]
The liquid flows from between her legs, transparent and viscous.

[MSG$005FAB,19]
Yukiko "Ah...ahhh!"

[MSG$006061,11]
Glub...pop!

[MSG$006079,56]
At the same time, the blue vibrator pops out of her ass.

[MSG$0060BE,73]
It's glistening with her juice. It flops across her bed, still vibrating.

[MSG$006114,61]
My sister is still convulsing from the effects of her orgasm.

[MSG$006156,87]
When the wave of pleasure has passed, she lets out a deep sigh and loses consciousness.

[MSG$006238,5]
Click

[MSG$00624A,26]
I close the door silently.

[MSG$00630A,66]
I return to my room, wondering about what I just saw my sister do.

[MSG$006359,35]
Her unexpected behavior baffles me.

[MSG$006381,82]
Considering that she seemed so embarrassed, I must've been just as aroused myself.

[MSG$0063E0,53]
My sister suddenly engaging in crazed masturbation...

[MSG$006422,95]
Normally she doesn't even look like she'd do something like that, but today of all days, and to

[MSG$006486,41]
|do it so suddenly is definitely bizarre.

[MSG$0064BC,49]
Just then, I remember what Kitami said yesterday.

[MSG$0064F5,117]
"He's a kind of incubus, skilled in the art of lust. As a man, I'm sure you'll find a lot of use for him, won't you?"

[MSG$006577,55]
Don't tell me this was the power she was talking about?

[MSG$0065B3,42]
The servant-demon Kitami was loaning me...

[MSG$0065EA,14]
His name is...

[MSG$006605,17]
Minase "Rasha..."

[MSG$006630,106]
As soon as I utter the name, I feel the mark on my body, the triangular scar Kitami had scratched onto me,

[MSG$00669F,12]
throb hotly.

[MSG$0066B8,44]
I look down and see that it's swelling up...

[MSG$0066F1,52]
It's then that I feel something wriggling inside me.

[MSG$006732,63]
It's evil and cold, and at the same time it's lusciously sweet.

[MSG$00677E,61]
This mysterious entity within me is squirming inside my body.

[MSG$0067C0,56]
And for some reason, it also feels strangely familiar...

[MSG$00680D,93]
At the same time that I notice its existence, I also feel a powerful surge radiating from it.

[MSG$00686F,77]
I definitely possess some kind of mysterious power that I never had before...

[MSG$0068C9,50]
As if to test it out, I point to a cup on my desk.

[MSG$0069C0,6]
Crack!

[MSG$0069D3,38]
The cup on my desk instantly shatters.

[MSG$0069FE,24]
I can't believe my eyes.

[MSG$006A23,21]
There's no mistake...

[MSG$006A45,58]
Minase "This is amazing. To think I have power like this."

[MSG$006A99,45]
I'm excited to see the effects of this power.

[MSG$006AD3,45]
An obedient demon who heeds my every order...

[MSG$006B05,45]
There's no need for arcane chants or rituals.

[MSG$006B3F,17]
Minase "(laughs)"

[MSG$006B6A,58]
I shiver with excitement. My face breaks out into a smile.

[MSG$006BA9,61]
I feel as though there's nothing in the world I have to fear.

[MSG$006C6F,12]
Ding-dong...

[MSG$006C88,30]
Just then, the doorbell rings.

[MSG$006CAB,21]
It's got to be Imari.

[MSG$006CCD,69]
I've got to make sure she doesn't notice anything different about me.

[MSG$006D1F,114]
It's still an unknown power to me. I've got to restrain myself from conspicuous behavior until I've mastered it...

[MSG$006D9E,16]
April 25 - Foyer

[MSG$006E35,8]
Click...

[MSG$006E4A,54]
I unlock the door before Imari does and open the door.

[MSG$006EBF,11]
Imari "Oh!"

[MSG$006EE4,77]
Imari is thrown inside, since she'd been just about to open the door herself.

[MSG$006F3E,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$006F63,52]
Imari stares at the sight of me standing before her.

[MSG$006FA4,16]
Rub, rub, rub...

[MSG$006FC1,51]
Imari blinks her eyes, then rubs them in disbelief.

[MSG$007001,22]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$007031,16]
Rub, rub, rub...

[MSG$00704E,28]
She rubs her eyes some more.

[MSG$007077,32]
Imari "I must be hallucinating."

[MSG$0070B1,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$0070D8,19]
Imari "All righty."

[MSG$007129,74]
Imari  takes off her shoes, walks right past me and heads towards my room.

[MSG$007180,41]
Minase "You're not hallucinating, Imari."

[MSG$0071F5,40]
I grab her by the arm and pull her back.

[MSG$00722A,63]
Imari "Whaaat? No way, you'd never get up on your own, Minase!"

[MSG$007283,55]
Just like my sister, Imari goes overboard in her shock.

[MSG$0072C7,40]
Minase "But I have, so what can you do?"

[MSG$007309,11]
Imari "Oh!"

[MSG$00732E,73]
Imari "Seems like I have no choice...all right, you woke up on your own."

[MSG$007391,26]
April 25 - Going to School

[MSG$007436,75]
Imari "If you'd get up on your own like this everyday it would help a lot."

[MSG$00749B,49]
Imari makes this comment as we walk side by side.

[MSG$0074D9,72]
Imari "But I guess it wouldn't really be a good thing if that happened."

[MSG$00753B,76]
Imari "Because then there'd be no need for me to come over and wake you up."

[MSG$0075A1,28]
She's contradicting herself.

[MSG$0075CA,32]
Minase "What's wrong with that?"

[MSG$007604,69]
Imari "Well, I'm so used to coming over to wake you up every morning.

[MSG$00764E,51]
If I didn't have to do it anymore it'd feel weird."

[MSG$00769B,77]
Imari "I even start heading over to your place on Sunday mornings sometimes."

[MSG$007702,43]
Imari "I'm so eager to wake you up, see..."

[MSG$007747,47]
What is she, a junkie with withdrawal symptoms?

[MSG$007783,102]
Imari "Still, I don't mind having a day like today once in a while. It's refreshing, don't you think?"

[MSG$007803,45]
Minase "Not really. It's the same as always."

[MSG$00784A,27]
Imari "You're really mean!"

[MSG$007939,39]
Imari "Hey...that's Shiraki, isn't it?"

[MSG$00797A,58]
We're changing into our school shoes when Imari says this.

[MSG$0079B9,52]
I look over and Shiraki's standing there, all right.

[MSG$007A50,38]
Imari "Is she staring at you or what?"

[MSG$007A90,59]
It's true, Shiraki's standing there staring at me steadily.

[MSG$007AD0,51]
But I'm not in the mood to deal with Shiraki today.

[MSG$007B10,38]
Minase "You're just imagining things."

[MSG$007B50,51]
With that, I hurriedly change into my school shoes.

[MSG$007B90,71]
Imari "Probably. Shiraki wouldn't be interested in you, of all people."

[MSG$007BF1,82]
Imari smiles as she says this, and starts off towards our classroom. I follow her,

[MSG$007C48,24]
ignoring Shiraki's gaze.

[MSG$007D28,18]
April 25 - Morning

[MSG$007DB9,14]
The door opens

[MSG$007DD4,25]
We enter our first class.

[MSG$007DFA,71]
Since we left home on time, there aren't many students in the room yet.

[MSG$007E4E,37]
I start looking for Saeki right away,

[MSG$007E80,47]
so I can get my Book of Magic back immediately.

[MSG$007EB4,45]
I've got to get it back today no matter what.

[MSG$007EEE,31]
But I don't see Saeki anywhere.

[MSG$007F1A,44]
I know I saw her street shoes in her locker.

[MSG$007F4B,38]
There's no question she's at school...

[MSG$007F7E,36]
I notice Murai, and call out to her.

[MSG$007FE1,15]
Minase "Murai."

[MSG$00800A,27]
Murai "What is it, Minase?"

[MSG$008040,29]
Minase "Have you seen Saeki?"

[MSG$008077,87]
Murai "Saeki? As soon as she got here, she said she was going to the campus infirmary."

[MSG$0080E8,21]
Minase "Infirmary..."

[MSG$008117,83]
That Saeki...why the hell would she go to the infirmary first thing in the morning?

[MSG$008177,53]
I set my bag on my desk, and start to leave the room.

[MSG$00820F,28]
Imari "Where are you going?"

[MSG$008245,22]
Minase "The bathroom."

[MSG$008275,15]
Imari "Again?!"

[MSG$00831A,57]
I arrive at the infirmary and reach out to open the door.

[MSG$008360,12]
Click, click

[MSG$008379,34]
Minase "Damn, it's not even open!"

[MSG$0083B5,64]
The door to the campus infirmary is locked and refuses to budge.

[MSG$008402,32]
Did Saeki lie about coming here?

[MSG$00842F,41]
I give up and head back to the classroom.

[MSG$008465,16]
April 25 - Saeki

[MSG$008545,47]
The first bell rings, but Saeki doesn't return.

[MSG$008581,64]
It's not like her...She's hardly ever late for class, or absent.

[MSG$0085C6,20]
And I saw her shoes.

[MSG$0085E7,76]
I really doubt she'd walk home barefoot. She's got to be somewhere around...

[MSG$008640,95]
Don't tell me she can't bring herself to come to class because she doesn't want to run into me?

[MSG$0086AC,111]
But in that case, she didn't have to come to school at all. Besides, she's not the type to avoid confrontation.

[MSG$0087B8,24]
........................

[MSG$0087DD,18]
..................

[MSG$0087FC,12]
............

[MSG$008815,6]
......

[MSG$0088A4,12]
Door opening

[MSG$0088EF,61]
Not long after class starts, the door opens and Saeki enters.

[MSG$008939,27]
Saeki "I'm sorry I'm late."

[MSG$00896E,38]
With that, Saeki goes to her own seat.

[MSG$0089C5,27]
There she is, damned witch.

[MSG$0089E5,55]
As soon as class is over, I'm gonna give her an earful.

[MSG$008A29,45]
With that thought in my mind, I glare at her.

[MSG$008A5B,68]
As if she feels me staring at her, she turns and gazes coldly at me.

[MSG$008B28,45]
Our eyes meet in the middle of the classroom.

[MSG$008B5A,32]
Then Saeki smiles faintly at me.

[MSG$008B87,57]
Damn Saeki, what's she thinking, smiling at me like that?

[MSG$008BCD,71]
Just wait, I'll take that confident smile of hers and rip it to shreds.

[MSG$008C19,64]
I can have these aggressive thoughts when I'm up against a girl.

[MSG$008C66,92]
The instant this thought goes through my head, the pencil in my hand suddenly grows heavy...

[MSG$008CCF,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$008D63,57]
I turn my gaze away from Saeki, and look down at my hand.

[MSG$008DA1,76]
The pencil I'm holding seems to have a life of its own and refuses to budge.

[MSG$008DFA,40]
I feel uneasy, and let go of the pencil.

[MSG$008EC0,21]
Minase "What the...?"

[MSG$008EEF,24]
I can't believe my eyes.

[MSG$008F14,74]
I let go of the pencil, but it's suspended in the air, absolutely still...

[MSG$008F63,100]
The lead's still pressed against my notebook, and the pencil is sticking up at an unnatural angle...

[MSG$008FD4,24]
I swipe my hand over it.

[MSG$008FF1,57]
But it doesn't seem to be attached to a wire or anything.

[MSG$009037,82]
This pencil is defying the physical laws of gravity! I scream this inside my head.

[MSG$009096,19]
Click, click, click

[MSG$0090B6,116]
As I stare in consternation, the top of the pencil clicks downwards on its own, and the lead comes out from the tip.

[MSG$00912F,43]
Jeez! I stare at this with my eyes bulging.

[MSG$009167,74]
This is just an ordinary mechanical pencil. No tricks, no secret features.

[MSG$0091B6,47]
But this is going on right before my very eyes.

[MSG$00926B,28]
Scratch, scratch, scratch...

[MSG$009294,53]
Now the pen starts gliding smoothly over my notebook.

[MSG$0092CE,28]
It leaves dark lines behind.

[MSG$0092F7,28]
Scratch, scratch, scratch...

[MSG$009320,32]
First, it draws a diagonal line.

[MSG$009345,52]
It's as accurate as if it's been drawn with a ruler.

[MSG$00937E,71]
Actually, even with a ruler you couldn't draw a line this accurately...

[MSG$0093D2,28]
Scratch, scratch, scratch...

[MSG$0093FB,48]
Then it turns sharply, and draws an acute angle.

[MSG$009438,28]
Scratch, scratch, scratch...

[MSG$009461,112]
The pencil goes back and forth several times, never pausing once, and it's drawing some kind of geometric shape.

[MSG$009567,33]
Scratch, scratch, scratch, thump!

[MSG$009595,70]
Finally the pencil is finished drawing, and falls weakly onto my desk.

[MSG$0095E0,66]
It's drawn something that looks like a big, upside-down pentagram.

[MSG$00962F,33]
Minase "An inverted pentagram..."

[MSG$00966A,65]
No question, it's an inverted pentagram. The symbol of the devil.

[MSG$0096B8,100]
The pentagram is the symbol of God. Its five protruding points symbolize the head, hands and feet...

[MSG$009721,16]
the body of God.

[MSG$00973E,80]
But if it's inverted, it looks like a two-horned goat...the symbol of the devil.

[MSG$00979B,31]
I quickly glance over at Saeki.

[MSG$009843,11]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$00985B,71]
Saeki has seen the astonished look on my face and she's laughing at me.

[MSG$0098AF,13]
That bitch...

[MSG$0098C1,33]
Don't tell me this is her doing!?

[MSG$0098EF,27]
But if so, how'd she do it?

[MSG$009917,48]
There's no sign that she used the Book of Magic.

[MSG$00994C,94]
And I find it hard to believe that what happened just now was solely due to that book's power.

[MSG$0099B7,114]
She couldn't have performed that ritual in the basement...no, that's ridiculous. No way could Saeki pull that off.

[MSG$009A36,32]
Then how the hell did she do it?

[MSG$009A5B,73]
She's still leering at me, as if she can't get over how taken aback I am.

[MSG$009B46,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$009B5D,5]
Thump

[MSG$009B6F,29]
I stand up as the bell rings.

[MSG$009B91,43]
And I head over to Saeki's seat right away.

[MSG$009C4C,31]
Minase "Hey you, come with me!"

[MSG$009C85,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$009C9D,42]
I make her step out into the hall with me.

[MSG$009CCC,24]
She follows me silently.

[MSG$009CF1,15]
April 25 - Hall

[MSG$009DA2,37]
Minase "What the hell are you up to?"

[MSG$009DE1,60]
I lead her out into the hall and interrogate her right away.

[MSG$009E2A,25]
Saeki "What do you mean?"

[MSG$009E5D,23]
Saeki feigns innocence.

[MSG$009E79,36]
She has a faint smile on her face...

[MSG$009EAA,91]
Minase "What do YOU mean, pulling a stunt like that? And how'd you get that kind of power?"

[MSG$009F1F,87]
Saeki "Why should I have to explain it to you? Besides, even if I did, a moron like you

[MSG$009F7B,31]
|wouldn't be able to grasp it."

[MSG$009FB4,29]
Minase "Don't screw with me!"

[MSG$009FEB,92]
Minase "I know you went to the basement yesterday. What the hell were you doing down there?"

[MSG$00A061,35]
Saeki "It's none of your business."

[MSG$00A09E,36]
Minase "So you're not talking, huh?"

[MSG$00A0DC,36]
Saeki "I don't see why I have to..."

[MSG$00A11A,23]
Minase "Goddamn you..."

[MSG$00A14C,45]
Saeki's suddenly giving me all this attitude.

[MSG$00A17E,51]
I'm not gonna get anywhere with her at this rate...

[MSG$00A1BE,53]
Minase "Okay, whatever. Just give me back that book!"

[MSG$00A20D,21]
Saeki "Why should I?"

[MSG$00A23D,17]
Minase "Eff you!"

[MSG$00A27C,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00A28F,66]
I'm enraged by Saeki's attitude, and I slam my fist into the wall.

[MSG$00A2D6,63]
Saeki's unfazed, and stands there with a cool look on her face.

[MSG$00A322,94]
Saeki "That book doesn't belong to you, You have no right to force me to give it back to you."

[MSG$00A39A,45]
Minase "Don't gimme that. Just hand it over!"

[MSG$00A3F2,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$00A409,43]
As if in reply to my words, the bell rings.

[MSG$00A441,29]
Saeki "Oh, there's the bell."

[MSG$00A49C,44]
Ignoring me, Saeki starts to go back inside.

[MSG$00A4D5,48]
Minase "Come back here! We're not through here."

[MSG$00A551,54]
At this, Saeki's eyes turn flinty as she glares at me.

[MSG$00A594,67]
Saeki "Stop being so annoying. If you keep this up, I'll kill you."

[MSG$00A5F1,49]
In that moment, I feel my spine tingle with fear.

[MSG$00A627,24]
This bitch is serious...

[MSG$00A670,50]
With that, Saeki flounces back into the classroom.

[MSG$00A6AF,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$00A6C8,27]
She's totally dissing me...

[MSG$00A6F0,22]
April 25 - After Class

[MSG$00A7FE,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$00A815,62]
The last bell rings, signaling the end of classes for the day.

[MSG$00A860,55]
I haven't heard a word my professors have said all day.

[MSG$00A89C,82]
I'm so preoccupied with what Saeki said to me that I can't think of anything else.

[MSG$00A8FB,92]
Saeki's acquired the power. She'd gone to the basement room, and something happened there...

[MSG$00A964,16]
What the hell...

[MSG$00A9BB,17]
Imari "Minase..."

[MSG$00A9E6,37]
Imari's voice interrupts my thoughts.

[MSG$00AA18,19]
Minase "Huh? What?"

[MSG$00AA45,69]
Imari "What do you mean, what? Time for the club meeting, of course!"

[MSG$00AAA4,66]
Minase "Oh, yeah, that's right. School's over for the day, right?"

[MSG$00AB00,54]
Imari "Get a grip, will you? You're so absent-minded."

[MSG$00AB50,31]
Imari looks at me with disgust.

[MSG$00AB7C,78]
Obediently, I stand up. Saeki's words were so shocking to me that I can barely

[MSG$00ABCF,7]
|think.

[MSG$00ABE3,74]
Imari "Hey, you're not going to try and escape today. Now that's unusual."

[MSG$00AC47,16]
Minase "Yeah..."

[MSG$00AC71,60]
Imari "Good timing. I have something I need to take care of,

[MSG$00ACB2,62]
so could you go on ahead and unlock the door to the Art Room?"

[MSG$00AD0A,23]
Minase "Sure thing.,.."

[MSG$00AD3B,43]
Imari "All right, then. I'll see you soon."

[MSG$00AD80,16]
Minase "Yeah..."

[MSG$00ADCE,43]
With that, Imari hurriedly leaves the room.

[MSG$00AE06,114]
Still in a daze, I plod towards the Faculty Room to retrieve the key to the Art Room, just like Imari asked me to.

[MSG$00AE85,15]
April 25 - Hall

[MSG$00AF1F,52]
On the way, I continue to obsess over Saeki's words.

[MSG$00AF58,31]
I've got to stop her somehow...

[MSG$00AF84,48]
I know I'm to blame for letting it come to this.

[MSG$00AFB9,72]
I'd like nothing more than to run away from it all, but if Saeki were to

[MSG$00B006,57]
|abuse that power, I know there'll be irreparable damage.

[MSG$00B04C,118]
Should I just go to the police? No, that's not going to get me anywhere. I just don't see the cops taking me seriously

[MSG$00B0C7,32]
|if I mention magic and witches.

[MSG$00B0F4,55]
There's no one at all who would believe such a story...

[MSG$00B138,23]
April 25 - Faculty Room

[MSG$00B1CE,64]
I enter the Faculty Room, and reach for the key to the Art Room.

[MSG$00B297,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00B2C6,99]
Without thinking, I look towards the edge of the box and see that the basement room key is missing.

[MSG$00B336,62]
Minase "It's gone...does that mean someone's gone down there?"

[MSG$00B38E,99]
As soon as I see this, I don't even pick up the Art Room key. I immediately leave the Faculty Room.

[MSG$00B3FE,40]
April 25 - In front of the basement room

[MSG$00B4B1,87]
Once I'm front of the basement room, I can see through the window that the light is on.

[MSG$00B515,42]
Just as I thought, someone's down there...

[MSG$00B54C,22]
Thump, thump, thump...

[MSG$00B56F,92]
Just as I have this thought, I can hear the faint footsteps of someone coming up the stairs.

[MSG$00B5D8,73]
Instantly I hide myself in the shadows, and wait for someone to emerge...

[MSG$00B626,32]
Why would someone be down there?

[MSG$00B653,8]
Click...

[MSG$00B668,53]
The knob turns, the door opens, and a shadow appears.

[MSG$00B748,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00B76F,34]
I'm confused when I see who it is.

[MSG$00B796,34]
It's not who I'm expecting at all.

[MSG$00B7C5,16]
Ms. Takashiro...

[MSG$00B7E2,91]
She steps into the hall and shuts the door. She glances around herself before she locks it.

[MSG$00B84A,43]
Why the hell would Takashiro be down there?

[MSG$00B8A6,88]
She puts the key in her pocket, and starts walking down the hall as if nothing happened.

[MSG$00B90B,27]
I go after her immediately.

[MSG$00B92B,54]
I'm planning to ask her what she was doing down there.

[MSG$00B96E,23]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$00B99F,71]
At the sound of my voice, Takashiro flinches, then slowly turns around.

[MSG$00BA2D,52]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. What's the matter?"

[MSG$00BA7B,52]
Minase "You were down in the basement, weren't you?"

[MSG$00BAC9,17]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$00BAF4,45]
Takashiro is clearly unnerved by my question.

[MSG$00BB2E,40]
Minase "What were you doing down there?"

[MSG$00BB70,67]
Takashiro "I...I was just getting something from the storage room."

[MSG$00BBCD,23]
She stammers her reply.

[MSG$00BBE9,111]
Something's definitely up. There's no storage room down there. And besides, she's not holding anything, either.

[MSG$00BC65,85]
This teacher knows something...The fact that she's trying to cover it up proves that.

[MSG$00BCC7,54]
Minase "I know all about it. What that room's like..."

[MSG$00BD17,15]
Takashiro "..."

[MSG$00BD40,61]
When she hears this, Takashiro looks at me with serious eyes.

[MSG$00BD8A,33]
Takashiro "How much do you know?"

[MSG$00BDC5,43]
Minase "I went inside, Inside that room..."

[MSG$00BE0A,23]
There's a long silence.

[MSG$00BE2E,18]
Takashiro "I see."

[MSG$00BE5A,59]
Takashiro "Come with me, then, I can't talk about it here."

[MSG$00BEAF,41]
With that, Takashiro starts walking away.

[MSG$00BEDD,13]
I follow her.

[MSG$00BEF7,37]
April 25 - Behind the School Building

[MSG$00BFBE,67]
Takashiro "So it was you...I did have a feeling it might be you..."

[MSG$00C01B,82]
Takashiro takes me behind the school building, and starts speaking in a low voice.

[MSG$00C07A,64]
Minase "Do you know something about what happened in that room?"

[MSG$00C0D4,68]
Takashiro "If you've seen that room, then you've seen everything..."

[MSG$00C132,99]
Takashiro "It's not fake and it's not a lie...that's the truth about what happened 12 years ago..."

[MSG$00C1AF,38]
Minase "I want to know more about it."

[MSG$00C1EF,40]
Takashiro "But why do you want to know?"

[MSG$00C231,31]
Minase "I want you to help me."

[MSG$00C26A,21]
Takashiro "Help you?"

[MSG$00C299,42]
Takashiro cocks her head at me doubtfully.

[MSG$00C2D0,59]
Minase "It was in that room that I found it...that book..."

[MSG$00C325,17]
Takashiro "Book?"

[MSG$00C350,43]
Minase "An old book, with a black cover..."

[MSG$00C395,62]
As soon as she hears this, Takashiro's eyes change expression.

[MSG$00C3E0,79]
Takashiro "You're not talking about that book with the hexagram on the cover?!"

[MSG$00C449,32]
Minase "It did have a hexagram."

[MSG$00C483,32]
Takashiro "You found that book?"

[MSG$00C4BD,6]
I nod.

[MSG$00C4D0,88]
Takashiro "I never dreamed...I never dreamed the book was hidden in that room. No wonder

[MSG$00C52D,28]
|nobody could ever find it."

[MSG$00C563,93]
Takashiro "So...all those rumors about you practicing Black Magic were because of that book?"

[MSG$00C5DA,59]
She looks at me with an exasperated expression on her face.

[MSG$00C622,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$00C648,70]
Takashiro "(Sighs) What have you done? Using that book of all things!"

[MSG$00C6A8,98]
Takashiro "Oh, never mind. Thank goodness you told me about this before it was too late to fix it.

[MSG$00C70F,93]
If that book falls into the wrong hands, there'll be a repeat of what happened 12 years ago."

[MSG$00C786,65]
Takashiro "All right, so you've got the book now, is that right?"

[MSG$00C7E1,45]
Timidly I tell her that Saeki's got the book.

[MSG$00C81B,22]
Takashiro "Seriously?"

[MSG$00C84B,45]
Takashiro is so stunned she raises her voice.

[MSG$00C885,85]
Takashiro "She's the last person you'd want to see with that book in her possession."

[MSG$00C8F4,57]
Minase "I'm sorry...I never thought this would happen..."

[MSG$00C947,70]
Minase "But why do you know so much about what happened 12 years ago?"

[MSG$00C9A7,119]
She's momentarily unsure of herself when I ask her this, but then she seems to come to a decision. She starts to speak.

[MSG$00CA2B,62]
Takashiro "All right, I'll tell you everything. Come with me."

[MSG$00CA83,28]
Minase "Where are we going?"

[MSG$00CAB9,93]
Takashiro "The place where it all began, and where it all ended...the basement storage room."

[MSG$00CB30,25]
With that, she walks off.

[MSG$00CB56,40]
April 25 - In front of the basement room

[MSG$00CC09,53]
We enter the door with the sign reading ''No Entry.''

[MSG$00CC4B,50]
Takashiro closes the door, and turns on the light.

[MSG$00CD02,5]
Click

[MSG$00CD14,50]
Minase "Do you go down there a lot? To that room?"

[MSG$00CD60,21]
I ask Takashiro this.

[MSG$00CD82,83]
Takashiro "No. Until I realized you were going down there, I'd always stayed away."

[MSG$00CDEF,62]
Takashiro "If I had a choice, I wouldn't ever go down here..."

[MSG$00CE47,57]
With that, Takashiro slowly starts to descend the stairs.

[MSG$00CE8D,24]
Thump...thump...thump...

[MSG$00CF2E,90]
When we reach the bottom of the stairs, we find ourselves in front of the cold steel door.

[MSG$00CF95,82]
Takashiro takes the key from her pocket, inserts it in the keyhole, and twists it.

[MSG$00CFF4,8]
Clink...

[MSG$00D009,71]
She returns the key to her pocket, and traces the graffiti on the door.

[MSG$00D05D,77]
Takashiro "All set with yron teeth in raunges twaine/That terrifide his foes,

[MSG$00D0AF,64]
and armed him/Appearing like the mouth of Orcus griesly grim..."

[MSG$00D109,21]
Minase "What's that?"

[MSG$00D138,99]
Takashiro "A quote from Spenser's The Faerie Queen. What you see written here describes this room."

[MSG$00D1B5,84]
Takashiro "Satan is the sword-bearing dragon. And Orcus is the Latin term for Hell."

[MSG$00D223,44]
Takashiro "In other words, this place is..."

[MSG$00D269,68]
Takashiro takes hold of the doorknob and turns it, opening the door.

[MSG$00D2BA,8]
Creak...

[MSG$00D2CF,35]
Takashiro "The entrance to Hell..."

[MSG$00D30C,24]
April 25 - Basement Room

[MSG$00D422,36]
We step into the jet-black darkness.

[MSG$00D44B,85]
I take my lighter from my pocket, and grope around in the darkness to light a candle.

[MSG$00D526,90]
The light from the candle illuminates the altar, which is just as I left it the other day.

[MSG$00D5BF,67]
Takashiro "I don't approve of your carrying that lighter with you."

[MSG$00D61C,58]
Minase "No harm if I'm just carrying it around, is there?"

[MSG$00D670,29]
We look around the dark room.

[MSG$00D69A,79]
The magic circles drawn on the floor...the altar...the walls and the ceiling...

[MSG$00D6EE,86]
Takashiro is staring at her surroundings as though she's remembering her hellish past.

[MSG$00D751,112]
Takashiro "This place hasn't changed...It's just like it was 12 years ago...It's as if time has come to a stop."

[MSG$00D7DB,73]
Takashiro "It was here that the Gate of Orcus was opened 12 years ago..."

[MSG$00D83E,74]
Takashiro "The gate between this world and Hell, used to summon demons..."

[MSG$00D8A2,73]
So saying, she stares at the smaller of the magic circles on the floor...

[MSG$00D8F8,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$00D911,43]
Takashiro "Now then, where should I start?"

[MSG$00DA40,37]
Takashiro "All right, I'll tell you."

[MSG$00DA7F,86]
Takashiro "You know that I graduated from this school, don't you? I was a student here

[MSG$00DADA,14]
12 years ago."

[MSG$00DB02,120]
Takashiro "You may have realized this, but I was a member of the Black Magic society you've heard all the rumors about."

[MSG$00DB94,94]
Takashiro "But just as the rumors say, all the members of that club were killed in the ritual.

[MSG$00DBF7,69]
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm still alive, if that's the case..."

[MSG$00DC56,105]
Takashiro "I'll tell you about that later. First, I'm going to tell you all about the Black Magic society

[MSG$00DCC4,20]
|from 12 years ago."

[MSG$00DCF2,54]
Takashiro "Like I said, that society really did exist.

[MSG$00DD2D,37]
It was called the Rose Cross Society.

[MSG$00DD57,91]
We named it after a secret organization from the Middle Ages called the Rosicrucian Order."

[MSG$00DDCC,67]
Takashiro "We formed our coven exactly one year before the tragedy.

[MSG$00DE14,54]
Including me, there were three of us in the beginning.

[MSG$00DE4F,61]
We were all in the same class, and were all into the occult."

[MSG$00DEA6,115]
Takashiro "At first, we'd just gather and imitate the Black Magic rituals we read about. It was quite innocuous..."

[MSG$00DF33,69]
Takashiro "And as time went on, we found ourselves with six members."

[MSG$00DF92,100]
Takashiro "By that time, we could no longer be satisfied by the occult books we could find in Japan.

[MSG$00DFFB,90]
So we started ordering foreign books and original manuscripts, and read them voraciously."

[MSG$00E06F,87]
Takashiro "And then one day, we acquired a certain book...the Book of Magic you found."

[MSG$00E0E0,98]
Takashiro "We tried out some the rituals in that book. When we discovered how effective they were,

[MSG$00E147,20]
we became obsessed."

[MSG$00E175,92]
Takashiro "We still had our ability to reason in the beginning...but that didn't last long."

[MSG$00E1EB,108]
Takashiro "Eventually, we took on other students as clients. We were paid to hex other people, we got rid of

[MSG$00E25C,85]
|all our opponents, and we punished anyone who defied us. We did whatever we wanted."

[MSG$00E2CB,64]
Takashiro "There was no one in school who hadn't heard about us.

[MSG$00E310,75]
It was around that time that we claimed this basement room for our own use.

[MSG$00E360,79]
The student council was terrified of us, so they were happy to let us have it."

[MSG$00E3C9,84]
Takashiro "The rituals we would perform in this room gradually began to escalate..."

[MSG$00E437,94]
Takashiro "We began to engage in the forbidden rituals, the ones we never should have touched.

[MSG$00E49A,60]
Spells to summon demons, and claim their power for our own."

[MSG$00E4F0,91]
Takashiro "And we decided to practice for this ritual by first summoning a low-level demon.

[MSG$00E550,35]
I was chosen to lead the ceremony."

[MSG$00E58D,92]
Takashiro "At the time, I had a lot of confidence in my powers, and I believed in that book.

[MSG$00E5EE,54]
But that turned out to be nothing but pure vanity...."

[MSG$00E63E,91]
Takashiro "The ritual started out smoothly, until that instant...It was an effective spell.

[MSG$00E69E,27]
Astonishingly effective..."

[MSG$00E6D3,66]
Takashiro "It was powerful enough to cause a demon to materialize.

[MSG$00E71A,87]
The demon possessed me, as I was the priestess, and it raped both my mind and my body."

[MSG$00E7BD,104]
Takashiro "I was powerless. The barrier field was breached, and I had no command over it. Instead it was

[MSG$00E82A,47]
|as if I were being manipulated by that demon."

[MSG$00E873,67]
Takashiro "It felt as though the demon was rubbing my raw nerves...

[MSG$00E8BB,71]
My mind wasn't able to withstand it, and it let out a scream inside me.

[MSG$00E907,72]
And that's when I saw it. The monstrously ugly demon who was raping me."

[MSG$00E969,67]
Takashiro "And then I had orgasm after orgasm, too many to count...

[MSG$00E9B1,47]
By the time I was released, my mind was a mess.

[MSG$00E9E5,39]
But I was lucky just to have survived."

[MSG$00EA26,120]
Takashiro "Because of the psychological shock I'd sustained, I fell into a coma for three days. I became painfully aware

[MSG$00EAA3,63]
|of what we were doing, and how terrifying and foolish it was."

[MSG$00EAFD,118]
Takashiro "I discovered once and for all that those demons weren't something we humans could ever wield control over."

[MSG$00EB8D,85]
Takashiro "And so I left the coven, and I never took part in another ritual again..."

[MSG$00EC2E,59]
Takashiro "That's my history with the Black Magic society."

[MSG$00ECEA,46]
Takashiro "We called that book 'Bible Black.'"

[MSG$00ED1D,67]
One of our members just happened to spot it in a used book catalog,

[MSG$00ED65,56]
and we were able to get it at a ridiculously low price."

[MSG$00EDB7,87]
Takashiro "That book contains numerous spells for causing demons to grant your desires.

[MSG$00EE13,53]
You know yourself how effective they are, don't you?"

[MSG$00EE62,112]
Takashiro "That grimoire is the gospel according to demons. It's nonsense to say it's recognized by the Church."

[MSG$00EEEC,111]
Takashiro "Good and evil are like yin and yang. In other words, demonic chants are the flip side to the Gospel.

[MSG$00EF60,66]
Those passages celebrating God and Jesus Christ are merely shams."

[MSG$00EFBC,107]
Takashiro "Even so, judging by the text of the grimoire, it's probably true that it was written by priests.

[MSG$00F02C,111]
It was written during the Middle Ages, when the Church prided itself on its skills at reproducing manuscripts."

[MSG$00F0B5,78]
Takashiro "But the book disappeared in the confusion of that tragic incident."

[MSG$00F108,43]
It's not as if I read everything about it."

[MSG$00F14D,102]
Takashiro "After it was all over, I did a lot of research on that book. And I learned a lot about it."

[MSG$00F1CD,68]
Takashiro "Its existence was first rumored during the 12th century."

[MSG$00F216,87]
It was said to be owned by one of the famous armies of the Crusades in medieval Europe,

[MSG$00F272,21]
the Knights Templar."

[MSG$00F2A1,97]
Takashiro "These Knights Templar borrowed the power of the grimoire, and were able to acquire for

[MSG$00F307,51]
|themselves all the wealth and glory of the world."

[MSG$00F354,94]
Takashiro "But they were condemned as heretics by King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V.

[MSG$00F3B7,81]
The last leader of the Knights Templar, Jacque du Molay, was burned at the stake,

[MSG$00F40D,49]
bringing this chapter of the grimoire to an end."

[MSG$00F459,85]
King Philip IV and Pope Clement V had found out about the power of the book, you see,

[MSG$00F4B3,117]
and they framed the Knights so they could steal its power for themselves, as well as the vast riches it would bring."

[MSG$00F542,110]
Takashiro "But all their scheming came to nothing, In the end, they failed to confiscate the Knights' fortune,

[MSG$00F5B5,59]
and they were never able to discover any of their secrets."

[MSG$00F60A,72]
Takashiro "The Knights had used a spell to discover the plot in advance,

[MSG$00F657,61]
so they'd already hidden away all their crucial possessions."

[MSG$00F6AE,51]
Takashiro "And the grimoire, having lost its owner,

[MSG$00F6E6,76]
passed from hand to hand to hand, no doubt ruining many lives along the way,

[MSG$00F737,35]
and somehow ended up in our hands."

[MSG$00F774,94]
Takashiro "Every time that book is opened, its demonic power drives the rational to insanity."

[MSG$00F81E,101]
Takashiro "And now the grimoire has been opened yet again. There might be another tragedy brewing..."

[MSG$00F904,84]
Takashiro "It's not as though I actually saw what they summoned, nor what happened."

[MSG$00F972,102]
Takashiro "But I do have a pretty good idea. So some of what I'm going to say is based on conjecture."

[MSG$00F9F3,68]
Takashiro "After I left the society, I stayed away from the members.

[MSG$00FA3C,86]
But when I heard rumors about the ritual they were about to try, I went to stop them."

[MSG$00FAAC,97]
Takashiro "After I quit, the remaining members performed the Gate-opening ritual in the grimoire,

[MSG$00FB12,51]
and they were planning to summon a powerful demon."

[MSG$00FB5F,96]
Takashiro "72 evil demons...There are different levels of demons, just as there are with angels,

[MSG$00FBC4,101]
and it's said that there are 72 powerful demons at the top. The girls in the society were planning to

[MSG$00FC2E,52]
|summon some of those 72, and borrow their power..."

[MSG$00FC7C,74]
Takashiro "I warned them over and over. It was just an impossible dream...

[MSG$00FCCB,91]
no human could ever hope to rule over a demon. I'd found that out for myself the hard way."

[MSG$00FD40,94]
Takashiro "But they'd been driven mad. They had no intention of giving up their foolish plan."

[MSG$00FDB8,101]
Takashiro "They ignored my repeated warnings, and performed the ritual in secret on Walpurgis Night."

[MSG$00FE37,112]
Takashiro "Unlike a low-level demon, summoning a high-level demon requires complex rituals and live sacrifices."

[MSG$00FEC1,78]
Takashiro "But that didn't stop them from carrying out their terrifying plan."

[MSG$00FF29,78]
Takashiro "They followed the book to the letter, and the Gate of Orcus opened.

[MSG$00FF7C,28]
And a demon was summoned..."

[MSG$00FFB2,119]
Takashiro "I heard about the ritual just before they started, and I ran downstairs to this basement room to stop them."

[MSG$010075,88]
Takashiro "But I didn't get there in time. By the time I saw this room, it was all over.

[MSG$0100D2,41]
What I saw was like a scene from Hell..."

[MSG$010115,105]
Takashiro "There was blood splattered all over the room, The smell of blood was enough to make you choke.

[MSG$010183,68]
All six girls were lying dead, with a look of terror on their faces.

[MSG$0101CC,31]
As if they'd seen the Devil..."

[MSG$010205,84]
Takashiro "But by the time I got here, I could no longer feel the demon's presence."

[MSG$010273,40]
Takashiro "And the grimoire was gone..."

[MSG$0102E7,96]
Takashiro "Fearing that the truth would leak out, the school authorities passed off the incident

[MSG$01034C,20]
|as a suicide pact."

[MSG$01037B,93]
Takashiro "And they locked the basement room door so that no one could ever enter it again...

[MSG$0103DD,57]
Like trying to sweep it under the rug, wouldn't you say?"

[MSG$010430,109]
Takashiro "Even after graduating, I couldn't get that basement room out of my mind. I just had a feeling that

[MSG$0104A2,53]
|someday, somebody might try to open the gate again."

[MSG$0104F1,101]
Takashiro "There were still a lot of unanswered questions, and I had no idea where the grimoire was."

[MSG$010570,109]
Takashiro "And then I became a professor, and whether by accident or by necessity, I returned to this school.

[MSG$0105E2,54]
And I've been guarding that basement room ever since."

[MSG$0106A2,94]
I grow doubtful when I realize that Takashiro's never mentioned Kitami, so I ask her about it.

[MSG$01070D,53]
Also, there are a few discrepancies in their stories.

[MSG$01074F,39]
Takashiro "Dr. Kitami? What about her?"

[MSG$010790,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$0107B7,36]
I'm stunned by Takashiro's reaction.

[MSG$0107E0,65]
She sounds like she has no idea about Kitami's role in the story.

[MSG$01082E,42]
In the first place, if she knew about her,

[MSG$01085D,75]
there's no way she wouldn't do anything about her, being this close to her.

[MSG$0108B5,106]
Minase "I ran into Dr. Kitami in the basement room. She told me she'd participated in the ritual as well."

[MSG$010939,63]
The instant I tell her this, Takashiro is visibly consternated.

[MSG$010985,96]
Takashiro "She couldn't have been. She wasn't a member of our society. And besides, I don't know

[MSG$0109EA,13]
|her at all."

[MSG$010A11,111]
Minase "But Dr. Kitami told me she was the only one who acquired the dark power in that ritual and survived..."

[MSG$010A9A,80]
Minase "And she tried to talk me into joining her. Of course I turned her down."

[MSG$010B04,80]
Takashiro "Impossible! All of the club members died. I saw it with my own eyes!"

[MSG$010B6E,97]
Takashiro "And she said she'd acquired the dark power? She's got to be lying, a demon would never

[MSG$010BD4,68]
|descend into a human. The fact that everyone was killed proves it."

[MSG$010C32,54]
Takashiro is adamantly denying Kitami's participation.

[MSG$010C6D,38]
Who the hell am I supposed to believe?

[MSG$010CA0,101]
Minase "But Ms. Kitami knew about the grimoire, and she knew all about the basement and the rituals."

[MSG$010D1F,46]
Minase "And also, I've seen her use her power.

[MSG$010D52,86]
You could never use that kind of power if you didn't know anything about Black Magic."

[MSG$010DC2,81]
Takashiro "It can't be...Only a limited number of people know about the basement.

[MSG$010E18,78]
And only the members of the Black Magic society knew that the book existed..."

[MSG$010E80,100]
Takashiro "How in the world did she find out? But if she's able to wield some kind of magical power,

[MSG$010EE9,65]
then we can't very well stand by and let her get away with it..."

[MSG$010F44,53]
Takashiro "I'm going to look into this Kitami person.

[MSG$010F7E,69]
It will be better not to make any moves until I know more about her."

[MSG$010FDD,72]
Minase "Right. I'd rather not run into Dr. Kitami for a while myself..."

[MSG$01103F,98]
I say this remembering what I saw of Kitami in the basement. Based on that day, there's no telling

[MSG$0110A6,31]
|what she'd do to me next time.

[MSG$0110F5,58]
Takashiro says this when she's finished telling her story.

[MSG$01113C,73]
Takashiro "No matter what it takes, we've got to get that grimoire back."

[MSG$0111A0,97]
Takashiro "That book shouldn't even exist. We've got to burn it before the same horrible mistakes

[MSG$011206,17]
|are repeated..."

[MSG$011231,45]
Takashiro "Ms. Saeki has the book, you said?"

[MSG$011278,13]
Minase "Yes."

[MSG$01129F,55]
Takashiro "The girl with the Black Magic hobby, right?"

[MSG$0112F0,105]
I tell Takashiro about the rituals Saeki's been trying out in the rented room, and about the secret club.

[MSG$011366,92]
Takashiro "So the grimoire chose the appropriate owner. I wonder what her intentions are..."

[MSG$0113DC,43]
She thinks a moment, then checks her watch.

[MSG$011414,101]
Takashiro "She must've left school by now. Since tomorrow's Sunday, we won't see her until Monday..."

[MSG$011493,65]
Takashiro "All right. I'll have a talk with Ms. Saeki on Monday."

[MSG$0114EE,19]
Minase "All right."

[MSG$01151C,81]
Takashiro "I won't be seeing you tomorrow. I'll call you if I find out anything."

[MSG$011587,6]
I nod.

[MSG$01159A,105]
Takashiro "Now then, let's go back now. This isn't the kind of place you want to hang around for long..."

[MSG$01161D,19]
April 25 - Art Room

[MSG$011742,85]
Imari "Hey, where the heck were you? And you ran off without unlocking the Art Room."

[MSG$0117B1,94]
I enter the Art Room just as the meeting is ending, Imari is furious and starts yelling at me.

[MSG$01181C,17]
Minase "Sorry..."

[MSG$0118CA,57]
Takashiro "Forgive Minase, I'm the one who detained him."

[MSG$01194F,35]
Imari "So you were in on it, too?!"

[MSG$01198C,76]
Imari "Anyway, you could've at least told me before you went off like that."

[MSG$0119F2,38]
With that, Imari looks away in a huff.

[MSG$011A25,24]
Minase "Hey, I'm sorry."

[MSG$011A57,14]
Imari "Humph!"

[MSG$011A7F,49]
Takashiro "All right, why don't you two make up?"

[MSG$011ACA,69]
Takashiro looks uncomfortable, and she pushes the two of us together.

[MSG$011B1C,14]
Imari "Grr..."

[MSG$011B44,44]
Imari's sulking, but gradually she gives in.

[MSG$011B7D,56]
Takashiro "All right, then, let's get ready to go home."

[MSG$011BCF,68]
Everyone starts putting their stuff away, and we leave the Art Room.

[MSG$011C44,47]
Before leaving the room, Takashiro winks at me.

[MSG$011C78,42]
I've got a powerful ally in Takashiro now.

[MSG$011CAF,54]
Then Imari and I leave school together, and head home.

[MSG$011D6D,112]
Now that I think about it, even if I don't have the book in my possession, I still can't escape from it somehow.

[MSG$011DEA,40]
The demons are pursuing me relentlessly.

[MSG$011E17,71]
The Book of Magic, which is said to lead its owners into destruction...

[MSG$011E6B,82]
From the moment I took possession of that book, the demons had been seducing me...

[MSG$011ECA,67]
A teacher who claimed to be one of the witches from 12 years ago...

[MSG$011F1A,94]
Who said she'd returned to this school, and has been guarding the basement room all this time.

[MSG$011F7D,48]
I have no choice now but to trust in that power.

[MSG$011FBA,46]
So that I can go back to living my old life...

[MSG$011FF5,18]

[MSG$012047,20]
April 25 - Classroom

[MSG$0120DA,10]
Door opens

[MSG$0120F1,22]
I enter the classroom.

[MSG$01210C,71]
Since we left home on time, there aren't many students in the room yet.

[MSG$012160,26]
I start looking for Saeki.

[MSG$012187,98]
She'd invited me to come to the secret club meeting tonight. I'm going to tell her I'm not coming.

[MSG$0121EE,52]
I'm just not in the mood for that kind of thing now.

[MSG$01222F,31]
But I don't see Saeki anywhere.

[MSG$01225B,44]
I know I saw her street shoes in her locker.

[MSG$01228C,38]
There's no question she's at school...

[MSG$0122BF,36]
I notice Murai, and call out to her.

[MSG$012373,20]
Minase "Hey, Murai?"

[MSG$0123A1,27]
Murai "What is it, Minase?"

[MSG$0123D6,29]
Minase "Have you seen Saeki?"

[MSG$01240D,87]
Murai "Saeki? As soon as she got here, she said she was going to the campus infirmary."

[MSG$01247E,21]
Minase "Infirmary..."

[MSG$0124AD,46]
The infirmary...so she's gone to see Kitami...

[MSG$0124E0,67]
After what happened yesterday, she's the last person I want to see.

[MSG$012528,46]
Why would she go to see Kitami in the morning?

[MSG$01255B,16]
I feel uneasy...

[MSG$012570,51]
I set my bag on my desk, and hurry out of the room.

[MSG$0125B0,31]
I hope I'm just overreacting...

[MSG$0125DC,15]
April 25 - Hall

[MSG$01266A,57]
I arrive at the infirmary and reach out to open the door.

[MSG$0126B0,12]
Click, click

[MSG$0126C9,27]
Minase "Damn, it's locked!"

[MSG$0126FE,57]
The door to the infirmary is locked and refuses to budge.

[MSG$012744,32]
Did Saeki lie about coming here?

[MSG$012771,87]
Just in case, I press my ear to the door and try to hear if anything's going on inside.

[MSG$0127D5,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0127EE,52]
I strain my ears, and concentrate on trying to hear.

[MSG$01282F,19]
Click, click, click

[MSG$01284F,36]
I can hear some kind of faint noise.

[MSG$012880,33]
So somebody's in there after all.

[MSG$0128AE,42]
I focus even harder to sharpen my hearing.

[MSG$0128DD,69]
I cover my other ear, and concentrate only on the noises from inside.

[MSG$01292F,21]
Voice "Oh! Ah! AHHH!"

[MSG$01295E,11]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$012976,27]
I can hear voices, faintly.

[MSG$01299E,33]
Don't tell me Saeki's having...?!

[MSG$0129C4,105]
But I can't really make out what she's saying, and since it's all moans, I can't even be sure it's Saeki.

[MSG$012A3A,41]
Voice "Oh! So amazing! That feels great!"

[MSG$012A7D,53]
Kitami "I'll make you orgasm as often as you want..."

[MSG$012ACC,33]
I can hear another woman's voice.

[MSG$012AF2,30]
Right away I know it's Kitami.

[MSG$012B1D,54]
I visualize what's going on in there, and I'm aroused.

[MSG$012B60,22]
Throb, throb, throb...

[MSG$012B83,65]
I dismiss such thoughts, and once again concentrate on listening.

[MSG$012BC9,46]
Right now I don't have time to be so depraved.

[MSG$012C36,67]
Takashiro "What are you doing, leaning against the door like that?"

[MSG$012C93,56]
I jump away from the door at the sound of another voice.

[MSG$012CD0,66]
I see Takashiro looking at me with a questioning look on her face.

[MSG$012D1F,61]
Minase "Oh, well, you see, this door feels so nice and cool!"

[MSG$012D76,30]
Minase "Ahh, that feels good!"

[MSG$012DAE,64]
I rub my cheek against the door, and use that as my cover story.

[MSG$012DFB,51]
Takashiro "Really? That's a strange hobby to have."

[MSG$012E48,31]
Minase "Oh, I think so myself."

[MSG$012E81,61]
Takashiro "Sorry to interrupt, but the bell's about to ring."

[MSG$012ED8,48]
Minase "Oh, that's right. Well, too bad for me!"

[MSG$012F46,50]
I let out a forced laugh and beat it out of there.

[MSG$012F85,60]
Shit, she was looking at me as if she thought I was a freak.

[MSG$012FC6,46]
I'm sure she did think I was a freak just now.

[MSG$013001,20]
April 25 - Classroom

[MSG$013094,110]
I'm curious about what's going on in the infirmary, but since the bell rang, I reluctantly walk back to class.

[MSG$013107,77]
It wouldn't do to be standing there pressed up against the door during class.

[MSG$0131DD,71]
The professor arrives and starts class, but Saeki still doesn't return.

[MSG$013231,83]
It's not like Saeki. She may be other things, but she's hardly ever late or absent.

[MSG$013289,66]
So I guess that was Saeki's voice I heard in the nurse's office...

[MSG$0132D8,100]
Even if that's true, why would Saeki be doing something like that in the nurse's office with Kitami?

[MSG$013349,100]
I've heard rumors about Kitami bringing students into the infirmary and engaging in stuff like that,

[MSG$0133B2,63]
but for Saeki to be there now of all times is just too perfect.

[MSG$0133FE,39]
Then I remember what Kitami said to me.

[MSG$013432,44]
"I can find a replacement for you easily..."

[MSG$01346B,16]
Don't tell me...

[MSG$013504,14]
The door opens

[MSG$01351F,45]
Just then, the door opens and Saeki comes in.

[MSG$01358B,27]
Saeki "I'm sorry I'm late."

[MSG$0135C0,40]
With that, Saeki heads for her own seat.

[MSG$013619,40]
She looks pretty much the same as usual.

[MSG$01364E,63]
Anyway, I'm going to talk to her as soon as this class is over.

[MSG$013692,58]
I've got to decline her invitation to tonight's meeting...

[MSG$0136D9,61]
This is what I'm thinking as I idly watch what Saeki's doing.

[MSG$013723,67]
When she sits down, Saeki opens her bag and takes out her textbook.

[MSG$013773,25]
It's a thick, black book.

[MSG$013791,33]
It has a hexagram on the cover...

[MSG$0137BF,11]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$0137D7,8]
Thump...

[MSG$0137EC,47]
I suddenly get up from my seat when I see that.

[MSG$013820,51]
The professor glares at me, and I quickly sit down.

[MSG$013860,41]
Impossible...why does she have that book?

[MSG$013896,31]
I can only think of one answer.

[MSG$0138BA,23]
She got it from Kitami.

[MSG$0138DE,56]
Kitami has made contact with Saeki. As my replacement...

[MSG$013923,68]
Saeki senses that I'm staring at her and slowly turns to look at me.

[MSG$0139F0,64]
Saeki sees my look of consternation and smiles derisively at me.

[MSG$013A35,78]
I see the ''other'' Saeki now, the one she showed me a glimpse of in her room.

[MSG$013A90,63]
That day Saeki looked like someone who'd lost her own identity.

[MSG$013AD4,68]
Saeki as she is now and that Book of Magic are a match made in hell.

[MSG$013B25,71]
I've got to warn her in no uncertain terms...Once she loses all reason,

[MSG$013B71,30]
there'll be no stopping Saeki.

[MSG$013C29,14]
The bell rings

[MSG$013C44,8]
Thump...

[MSG$013C59,27]
I get up as the bell rings.

[MSG$013C79,33]
I head straight for Saeki's desk.

[MSG$013CD9,31]
Minase "Hey you, come with me!"

[MSG$013D12,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$013D2A,42]
I make her step out into the hall with me.

[MSG$013D59,24]
She follows me silently.

[MSG$013E1D,45]
Minase "I see you've been seduced by Kitami."

[MSG$013E64,46]
I rip into Saeki as soon as we're in the hall.

[MSG$013E9F,13]
Saeki "No..."

[MSG$013EC6,46]
Saeki looks at me as if my questions bore her.

[MSG$013EF9,34]
She has a faint smile on her lips.

[MSG$013F28,39]
Minase "Did Kitami give you that book?"

[MSG$013F69,24]
Saeki "What if she did?"

[MSG$013F9B,70]
Saeki "You were stingy with it, but Ms. Kitami gladly handed it over."

[MSG$013FFB,60]
Minase "You need to stay away from Kitami, she's not right."

[MSG$014051,50]
Saeki "Oh, no, on the contrary, I find her ideal."

[MSG$01409D,115]
True, for someone like Saeki who's so fixated on the coven from 12 years ago, Kitami's got to be the ideal partner.

[MSG$014115,48]
Nothing I say now will convince her otherwise...

[MSG$014152,32]
Minase "Do what you want, then."

[MSG$01418C,46]
Minase "Oh, and I'm not coming tonight, okay?"

[MSG$0141D4,49]
Saeki "Actually, we don't want you there, either.

[MSG$01420A,89]
Now that the secret of your tricks has been discovered, you can just step off the stage."

[MSG$01427D,16]
Minase "Grrr..."

[MSG$0142A7,60]
Minase "Anyway, I have nothing to do with that book anymore,

[MSG$0142E8,61]
so don't try to get me involved in any of your freaky plots!"

[MSG$01433F,51]
I spit this out at her as I try to control my fury.

[MSG$01437F,70]
Saeki "I can't give you any guarantees. You're already in quite deep."

[MSG$0143DF,39]
Minase "What's that supposed to mean?!"

[MSG$014420,46]
I can't take it anymore and I lunge for Saeki.

[MSG$01448D,23]
Saeki "Don't touch me!"

[MSG$014557,5]
Slam!

[MSG$014569,13]
Minase "Ugh!"

[MSG$014590,53]
In that moment, I'm thrown back by some unseen power.

[MSG$0145CA,25]
What the hell's going on?

[MSG$014622,63]
Saeki "Stupid boy. It looks like our roles are reversed now..."

[MSG$01467B,106]
Saeki "I'm grateful to you, of course. I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity if it hadn't been for you."

[MSG$0146FF,66]
She looks at me with a seductive smile on her face. I'm in a daze.

[MSG$01475F,15]
The bell rings.

[MSG$01477B,29]
Saeki "So that's the deal..."

[MSG$0147D6,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0147EF,66]
Saeki starts to flounce back into the classroom, leaving me there.

[MSG$01483E,29]
Minase "Hey, come back here!"

[MSG$014875,22]
I grab her by the arm.

[MSG$0148CA,71]
Saeki "This discussion is over...If you don't back off, I'll kill you."

[MSG$01492B,50]
When I hear that, I immediately let go of her arm.

[MSG$01498E,56]
Saeki sneers at me and goes back inside the classroom...

[MSG$0149D3,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0149EC,27]
She's totally dissing me...

[MSG$014A14,23]
April 25 - After School

[MSG$014B23,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$014B3A,62]
The last bell rings, signaling the end of classes for the day.

[MSG$014B85,50]
I haven't heard a word my professors said all day.

[MSG$014BBC,82]
I'm so preoccupied with what Saeki said to me that I can't think of anything else.

[MSG$014C1B,37]
Saeki's got the same power as Kitami.

[MSG$014C4D,19]
But why the hell...

[MSG$014C73,15]
April 25 - Hall

[MSG$014D06,54]
On the way to class, I see Kitami walking ahead of me.

[MSG$014D41,40]
I remember our meeting the day before...

[MSG$014D76,35]
But Kitami looks the same as usual,

[MSG$014D9E,37]
as if nothing had happened yesterday,

[MSG$014DC8,28]
She doesn't even look at me.

[MSG$014DF1,34]
Eventually I cross paths with her.

[MSG$014EA3,42]
Kitami "Come to the infirmary at lunch..."

[MSG$014EE7,60]
She whispers this message into my ear as we pass each other.

[MSG$014F54,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$014F6D,69]
I make sure Imari doesn't notice anything, and move away from Kitami.

[MSG$014FBF,20]
April 25 - Classroom

[MSG$015052,12]
Door opening

[MSG$01506B,25]
We enter our first class.

[MSG$015091,71]
Since we left home on time, there aren't many students in the room yet.

[MSG$0150E5,22]
I head toward my desk.

[MSG$015100,49]
When I pass by Saeki's desk, she calls out to me.

[MSG$0151C1,37]
Saeki "Don't forget about tonight..."

[MSG$015200,31]
Minase "I'll think about it..."

[MSG$01525D,42]
That's all I say as I sit down at my desk.

[MSG$01528C,79]
Now that I think of it, I'm supposed to be at that secret club meeting tonight.

[MSG$0152E8,74]
But at this point it just seems stupid to take part in their little games.

[MSG$015337,39]
After all, I know what true power is...

[MSG$01536B,35]
Well, I'll go if I'm in the mood...

[MSG$01539B,81]
If I show them the power I have now, what kind of look will I see on their faces?

[MSG$0153F1,61]
In that sense, it might not be a bad idea to go, after all...

[MSG$0155C5,16]
April 25 - Lunch

[MSG$01566D,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$015684,66]
When the bell rings at the end of class, Murai arrives at my desk.

[MSG$0156CB,47]
Uncharacteristically, Imari is not by her side.

[MSG$01578A,83]
Murai "Hey, Minase. Inoue says they'll be waiting for you up on the roof at lunch."

[MSG$0157F7,92]
Not them again...After all I'd put them through yesterday, they still wanted to call me out?

[MSG$015860,42]
Murai "I gave you the message, all right?"

[MSG$0158A4,61]
Murai "Make sure you go! If you don't they'll come after me."

[MSG$015970,78]
Murai is emphatic; she has a look of fear on her face. Then she scurries away.

[MSG$0159CB,41]
Minase "I guess I'll have to go, then..."

[MSG$015A0E,55]
It's a pain in the ass, but I have no choice but to go.

[MSG$015A52,80]
I've got to set them straight once and for all, or they'll never leave me alone.

[MSG$015AA7,33]
But Kitami wanted to see me, too.

[MSG$015AF5,58]
Minase "If it's those guys, I guess I can make them wait."

[MSG$015B49,38]
I decide to go to the infirmary first.

[MSG$015BF8,12]
Knock, knock

[MSG$015C11,49]
I arrive at the infirmary and knock just in case.

[MSG$015C4F,15]
No one answers.

[MSG$015C6B,14]
The door opens

[MSG$015D02,30]
I open the door and go inside.

[MSG$015D2D,22]
There's no one around.

[MSG$015D48,31]
But I can hear a faint sound...

[MSG$015D74,27]
Minase "It's me, Minase..."

[MSG$015DA9,29]
I call out to the empty room.

[MSG$015DD3,19]
Kitami "Over here."

[MSG$015E00,71]
I hear Kitami's voice from the back of the room, responding to my call.

[MSG$015E4C,37]
That's where the sound's coming from.

[MSG$015E7E,71]
I can hear a squishing sound along with heavy breathing from that area.

[MSG$015ECA,31]
Apparently, Kitami's not alone.

[MSG$015EF6,36]
Young Man "Oh....ahhh...Ms. Kitami!"

[MSG$015F34,62]
Just then I hear a guy's voice, so high he sounds like a girl.

[MSG$015F77,65]
I start walking in that direction. It's right where the beds are.

[MSG$016049,23]
Minase "What the hell?"

[MSG$01607A,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$0160A0,36]
Young Man "Oh....ahhh...Ms. Kitami!"

[MSG$0160DE,21]
I wince at the sight.

[MSG$016100,85]
There's a very feminine boy on the floor, practically a woman; his pants are down and

[MSG$01615A,58]
|he's writhing in pleasure as Kitami gives him a hand job.

[MSG$0161A1,113]
I can't believe this teacher is engaging in lewd acts with a student in broad daylight, and at school, to boot...

[MSG$01621F,67]
Kitami "You're a little early. Sorry, I'm a little busy right now."

[MSG$01627C,49]
Coming from Kitami, it doesn't sound like a joke.

[MSG$0162B2,41]
Don't tell me she does this all the time?

[MSG$0162E8,67]
Kitami "I hope you don't mind waiting a little, I'll be done soon."

[MSG$016345,62]
Kitami "Or would you like to give me some of your juice, too?"

[MSG$01639D,60]
Kitami says this and makes a licking motion with her tongue.

[MSG$016409,15]
Minase "Can I?"

[MSG$016432,103]
It would be too cruel of her to make me just stand by and watch while something like this was going on.

[MSG$0164A6,80]
Kitami "Of course you can. All right, take off your pants and come over here..."

[MSG$016510,86]
I do as she says and remove my pants and shorts, and thrust my prick in her direction.

[MSG$0165FC,48]
Kitami "My, your penis is already huge, Minase."

[MSG$016646,69]
Kitami "I like this fellow's prick, too, but I'm also fond of yours."

[MSG$0166A5,103]
Kitami stares in rapture at my throbbing prick and the feminine student's pink, innocent-looking penis.

[MSG$016719,41]
Kitami "Give me a lot of juice to drink."

[MSG$01675C,44]
With that, she pops my prick into her mouth.

[MSG$016795,27]
Kitami "Mmm...mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$0167CA,43]
Kitami begins to slurp noisily on my prick.

[MSG$0167FA,32]
As usual, she's damn good at it.

[MSG$016827,90]
While she's moving her mouth, she uses her hand to vigorously pumps the other guy's prick,

[MSG$016886,57]
which is so huge it doesn't go with the rest of his body.

[MSG$0168C4,68]
Both of us are writhing and shivering in pleasure, it feels so good.

[MSG$016915,22]
Slurp, slurp, slurp...

[MSG$016938,19]
Pump, pump, pump...

[MSG$016958,46]
Young Man "More...more...please, I want more!"

[MSG$0169A0,83]
I can hear the other student moan in a soprano voice. He really sounds like a girl.

[MSG$0169F8,43]
Soon both of us are on the brink of coming.

[MSG$016A30,22]
Slurp, slurp, slurp...

[MSG$016A53,19]
Pump, pump, pump...

[MSG$016A73,62]
Young Man "I'm going to come...I'm going to come right now..."

[MSG$016ACB,64]
As he receives Kitami's intense hand job, he lets out a whimper.

[MSG$016B18,46]
Minase "Ms. Kitami, I'm going to come, too..."

[MSG$016B60,40]
I'm ready to explode at any moment, too.

[MSG$016B95,55]
Kitami "Go ahead...Let out a ton of milk for me, boys!"

[MSG$016BE6,53]
With that, she holds our pricks in front of her face.

[MSG$016C28,52]
Young Man "Drink it...please, drink it, Ms. Kitami!"

[MSG$016C76,32]
Minase "Ms. Kitami, I'm coming!"

[MSG$016DA2,13]
(Juice flows)

[MSG$016DBC,13]
Spurt! Spurt!

[MSG$016DD6,17]
Kitami "(chokes)"

[MSG$016E01,66]
We both expel sprays of semen, which Kitami receives in her mouth.

[MSG$016E50,15]
Spurt, Spurt...

[MSG$016E6C,52]
The juice that misses her mouth drips down her body.

[MSG$016EA5,60]
Kitami's taking all this juice in her mouth and on her face.

[MSG$016EEE,18]
Kitami "So hot..."

[MSG$016F1A,46]
We both continue to ejaculate for a long time.

[MSG$016F4D,42]
Soon Kitami's face is dripping with juice.

[MSG$016FFD,57]
There's so much semen in her mouth that it's overflowing.

[MSG$017043,15]
Kitami "(gags)"

[MSG$01706C,75]
Kitami closes her mouth with the semen still in it, and begins to savor it.

[MSG$0170C4,7]
Gulp...

[MSG$0170D8,33]
Then she swallows it all at once.

[MSG$017106,66]
Kitami "Mmm...You can't beat freshly-milked semen from young men."

[MSG$017162,52]
Kitami "Both of your juice was thick beyond belief."

[MSG$0171B0,33]
Kitami flashes a satisfied smile.

[MSG$0171D6,118]
She looks like a little demon...If she felt like it, she could've gone on milking all the semen from us until we died.

[MSG$0172D6,39]
Kitami "All right, we're through here."

[MSG$017317,74]
Kitami "You can leave now. If I feel like it, I'll invite you here again."

[MSG$01737B,41]
We both put our shorts and pants back on.

[MSG$0173A9,58]
Kitami gets dressed too, and shoos the other student away.

[MSG$0173F0,96]
At Kitami's words, the guy whose semen Kitami just drank exits the infirmary, looking exhausted.

[MSG$017468,24]
Minase "Uh...no thanks."

[MSG$01749A,19]
I decline politely.

[MSG$0174BA,52]
True, this professor can make me feel really good...

[MSG$0174FB,94]
But not only will I feel extraordinary pleasure, she'll also suck away massive amounts of cum.

[MSG$01755E,57]
I'm not going to let her do that to me two days in a row.

[MSG$0175A4,28]
Kitami "Oh? That's too bad."

[MSG$0175DA,75]
Kitami "After all, I really am fond of the flavor and volume of your milk."

[MSG$01763F,36]
Kitami looks genuinely disappointed.

[MSG$017670,72]
Kitami "In that case, you'll have to pick up the slack for Minase, boy."

[MSG$0176D2,115]
She says this while staring down in rapture at the feminine student's innocent-looking prick, with its pinkish tip.

[MSG$017752,62]
Kitami "I'm going to pump it all out of you to the last drop."

[MSG$0177AA,71]
Kitami grips his virginal prick, starts rubbing vigorously at the base,

[MSG$0177F6,53]
and sticks the head into her mouth, slurping noisily.

[MSG$017838,27]
Kitami "Mmm...mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$01786D,22]
Slurp, slurp, slurp...

[MSG$017890,19]
Pump, pump, pump...

[MSG$0178B0,46]
Young Man "More...more...please, I want more!"

[MSG$0178F8,97]
I can hear the other student moan in a soprano voice. His voice really sounds just like a girl's.

[MSG$017966,94]
He must really be feeling good, because as he's writhing, his mouth keeps opening and closing.

[MSG$0179D1,22]
Slurp, slurp, slurp...

[MSG$0179F4,19]
Pump, pump, pump...

[MSG$017A14,36]
Young Man "Ms. Kitami...Ms. Kitami!"

[MSG$017A52,90]
With a look of ecstasy on his face, and saliva dribbling down his chin, the student starts

[MSG$017AB1,47]
|gyrating his hips. He's wallowing in his lust.

[MSG$017AED,77]
Kitami looks pleased to see his reaction, and mercilessly assaults his prick.

[MSG$017B47,62]
Young Man "I'm going to come...I'm going to come right now..."

[MSG$017B9F,64]
As he receives Kitami's intense hand job, he lets out a whimper.

[MSG$017BEC,54]
Kitami "Go ahead...Let out a ton of milk for me, boy!"

[MSG$017C3C,53]
She directs these words towards the feminine student,

[MSG$017C76,74]
repositions his prick in her mouth and readies herself to receive his cum.

[MSG$017CCD,35]
Young Man "I'm coming! I'm coming!"

[MSG$017D83,13]
(Juice flows)

[MSG$017D9D,13]
Spurt! Spurt!

[MSG$017DB7,17]
Kitami "(chokes)"

[MSG$017DEA,72]
As the student convulses, he expels a stream of cum into Kitami's mouth.

[MSG$017E3F,55]
Young Man "I'm coming...I'm letting out lots of cum..."

[MSG$017E90,13]
(Juice flows)

[MSG$017EAA,37]
He continues to come for a long time.

[MSG$017EDC,45]
Kitami noisily gulps down the spray of semen.

[MSG$017F16,59]
But it's such a massive amount that her mouth is soon full,

[MSG$017F56,63]
and the white cum leaks from her mouth, dripping down her chin.

[MSG$017FA2,66]
Kitami pumps out the last of the semen, as if she's milking a cow.

[MSG$017FF1,36]
Young Man "Ahhh...ahhh....ohhhh...."

[MSG$0180A8,19]
Cock pulling out...

[MSG$0180C8,46]
The student's prick is ejected from her mouth.

[MSG$0180FB,50]
As if he's been sucked dry, his prick is now limp.

[MSG$01813A,6]
Thump!

[MSG$01814D,47]
The student faints, falling over in exhaustion.

[MSG$018181,79]
His body is quivering with convulsions, and you can see the whites of his eyes.

[MSG$0181DD,60]
He looks as if he's had his entire spirit sucked out of him.

[MSG$01821E,88]
Just watching those two makes me feel as if my own spirit's getting sucked away as well.

[MSG$018283,18]
Kitami "(gagging)"

[MSG$0182AF,75]
Kitami closes her mouth with the semen still in it, and begins to savor it.

[MSG$018307,85]
There's so much cum that it's overflowing from her mouth, and it drips down her body.

[MSG$018369,7]
Gulp...

[MSG$01837D,51]
Then she swallows the cum in her mouth all at once.

[MSG$0183B5,85]
How can she swallow that stuff as if it's the most delicious thing she's ever tasted?

[MSG$01840F,40]
Just watching her makes me want to puke.

[MSG$018444,68]
Kitami "Mmm...You can't beat freshly-milked semen from a young man."

[MSG$0184A2,59]
Kitami "It's amazingly thick, and it's got a sharp flavor."

[MSG$0184F8,33]
Kitami flashes a satisfied smile.

[MSG$01851E,119]
She looks like a little demon...If she felt like it, she could've gone on milking all the semen from him until he died.

[MSG$0185A2,32]
Kitami "Oh, look, he's fainted."

[MSG$0185DC,99]
She says this as she looks down at the young man, who's lying there showing the whites of his eyes.

[MSG$01864C,44]
Kitami "Maybe I pumped too much out of him?"

[MSG$018723,72]
Kitami gets dressed, tossed him into bed, and covers him with a blanket.

[MSG$018770,79]
From the looks of it, he's going to be out of it for a good two or three hours.

[MSG$018850,41]
Kitami "All right, shall I tell you now?"

[MSG$018893,53]
Kitami returns to her normal self when she says this.

[MSG$0188D5,54]
Kitami "I trust you're enjoying the power I gave you?"

[MSG$018925,13]
Minase "Yes."

[MSG$01894C,19]
I nod at her words.

[MSG$01896C,18]
Kitami "I'm glad."

[MSG$018998,84]
Kitami "But if you desire it, you can acquire an even stronger power...like I have."

[MSG$018A06,28]
With that she smiles boldly.

[MSG$018A2F,71]
Kitami "For that to happen, I need you to help me with what I'm doing."

[MSG$018A7B,37]
That's why I took you in as an ally."

[MSG$018ABA,37]
Minase "What are you planning to do?"

[MSG$018AF9,59]
Kitami "I'll tell you all about it...why I came back here."

[MSG$018B4E,46]
Then she slowly begins to talk about her past.

[MSG$018B89,54]
Kitami "12 years ago, I sealed a pact with the devil."

[MSG$018BD9,80]
Kitami "And I acquired this power. I used this power to get everything I wanted.

[MSG$018C2E,37]
Wealth, glory, everything I desired."

[MSG$018C6D,57]
Kitami "But I knew that it would one day come to an end."

[MSG$018CC0,79]
Kitami "There was an expiration date, you see...and it was unbelievably short."

[MSG$018D29,18]
Minase "How long?"

[MSG$018D55,20]
Kitami "13 years..."

[MSG$018D83,19]
Minase "13 years?!"

[MSG$018DB0,61]
Kitami "And the next Night of Walpurgis marks the 13th year."

[MSG$018E07,33]
Minase "Then you've only 5 days?"

[MSG$018E42,22]
Kitami "That's right."

[MSG$018E72,55]
Minase "When the pact expires, what's going to happen?"

[MSG$018EC3,28]
Kitami "I'm going to die..."

[MSG$018EF9,74]
Kitami "That's what happens to those who've sold their souls to the devil.

[MSG$018F48,72]
When the time comes, I am bound to offer my body and soul to the devil."

[MSG$018FAA,71]
Kitami "Just like a candle. The harder it burns, the shorter its life."

[MSG$01900B,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$019024,53]
Kitami "But don't worry. I've found a way to escape."

[MSG$019073,79]
Kitami "For the first 10 years, I didn't even think about the pact expiring..."

[MSG$0190DC,85]
Kitami "But after 10 years had passed, I gradually began to feel the weight of fear."

[MSG$01914B,69]
Kitami "13 years is far too short. No matter how much power you have,

[MSG$019195,56]
it's pointless if you only have a short time to use it."

[MSG$0191E7,100]
Kitami "But it was already too late for regrets. Once I'd sealed the pact, there was no going back."

[MSG$019265,84]
Kitami "But I started looking desperately for a spell that would allow me to escape.

[MSG$0192BE,38]
But a pact with the devil is airtight.

[MSG$0192E9,54]
Once it's sealed, it can't be broken, no matter what."

[MSG$019339,80]
Kitami "But I didn't give up. I read scores of grimoires and ancient documents."

[MSG$0193A3,102]
Kitami "And while I was doing research on the origins of that grimoire, I discovered the first owners,

[MSG$01940E,23]
the Knights Templar..."

[MSG$01943F,94]
Kitami "And while I was studying about the Knights Templar, I stumbled upon a certain secret."

[MSG$0194B7,16]
Minase "Secret?"

[MSG$0194E1,78]
Kitami "The other owners were all killed early on, but the Knights Templar was

[MSG$019534,69]
|able to hold onto their power and wealth for more than 200 years..."

[MSG$019593,103]
Kitami "In order to investigate this secret, I joined a secret organization called the Prieure de Sion,

[MSG$0195FF,97]
said to have been involved in the founding of the Knights Templar, and which still exists today."

[MSG$01967B,63]
Kitami "And there I found the answer, among ancient documents."

[MSG$0196D4,97]
Kitami "The Knights Templar knew of a spell that would allow one to escape a pact with the devil.

[MSG$01973A,88]
It's thought the first Grand Master, Hugues de Payens, had sealed a pact with the devil.

[MSG$019797,84]
By performing a secret ritual he was able to maintain his power for over 200 years."

[MSG$019805,41]
Minase "But how the hell did he do that?"

[MSG$019848,28]
Kitami "By soul-succession."

[MSG$01987F,25]
Minase "Soul-succession?"

[MSG$0198B3,103]
Kitami "By excising the soul from the body, and transferring it to another body. It's a secret ritual."

[MSG$019934,78]
Kitami "Hugues de Payens performed this ceremony, and by transferring his soul

[MSG$019987,51]
|to another body he was able to deceive the devil."

[MSG$0199D4,57]
Kitami "So he cheated by switching his soul with another,

[MSG$019A12,64]
and managed to escape from the pact he'd sealed with the devil."

[MSG$019A6C,34]
Minase "How can that be possible?"

[MSG$019AA8,114]
Kitami "If I perform this ritual, I'll have nothing to fear. I might even go so far as to rule the world someday."

[MSG$019B34,64]
Kitami can barely contain her excitement as she speaks heatedly.

[MSG$019B81,92]
Kitami "And I've already deciphered that secret ritual. All I have to do now is perform it."

[MSG$019BF7,106]
Kitami "The ritual must be performed on Walpurgis Night, when the Power of the Darkness is the strongest."

[MSG$019C7B,27]
Minase "Walpurgis Night..."

[MSG$019CB0,95]
Kitami "That's right, The anniversary of what happened 13 years ago. I can't afford to fail..."

[MSG$019D29,48]
Kitami "Of course, you're going to help me out."

[MSG$019D73,35]
Minase "What do you want me to do?"

[MSG$019DB0,70]
Kitami "You're going to get rid of all those who might get in our way.

[MSG$019DFB,70]
I'd like to save as much of my power as I can until we do the ritual."

[MSG$019E5B,20]
Kitami "And also..."

[MSG$019E89,81]
Kitami "You're going to capture a new body for me. An appropriate body for me..."

[MSG$019EF4,27]
Minase "Who would that be?"

[MSG$019F29,24]
Kitami "Kurumi Imari..."

[MSG$019F5B,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$019F82,93]
Kitami "An unsoiled body, and a pure, innocent soul, She's the perfect victim for my ritual."

[MSG$019FF9,40]
This can't be...why Imari of all people?

[MSG$01A02E,102]
Kitami "The other day, when she was brought into the nurse's office, I made a thorough investigation."

[MSG$01A0AE,87]
Kitami "And I took a liking to her. I know her body will accept me without resistance."

[MSG$01A11F,45]
Minase "Can't you at least use someone else?"

[MSG$01A166,113]
Kitami "No, I can't. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten you involved. Since you know Imari better than anyone else.

[MSG$01A1DC,78]
If I didn't think you'd be of any use to me, I would've killed you that time."

[MSG$01A244,80]
Kitami "I know you can get a hold of that girl easily. She'd never suspect you."

[MSG$01A2AE,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$01A2C7,32]
Kitami "You can't back out now."

[MSG$01A301,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$01A31A,48]
Kitami "Besides, you like that girl, don't you?"

[MSG$01A384,31]
Minase "You're probably right."

[MSG$01A3BD,17]
I didn't deny it.

[MSG$01A3D3,62]
It's true that I might be feeling self-conscious around Imari.

[MSG$01A41E,64]
Kitami "If that's the case, then there's nothing to worry about.

[MSG$01A463,70]
If we succeed with the ritual, then you'll be able to sleep with her."

[MSG$01A4C3,69]
Kitami "I'll be happy to return your love, In Imari's body, that is."

[MSG$01A522,92]
Kitami "I can promise you the most amazing pleasure you'll ever know, once I'm in her body."

[MSG$01A598,49]
Kitami "Well? It's a pretty good deal, isn't it?"

[MSG$01A5E3,29]
At her words, I nod silently.

[MSG$01A60D,39]
True, if Kitami possesses Imari's body,

[MSG$01A639,81]
I'll be able to experience the kind of arousal I can only dream about with Imari.

[MSG$01A68F,59]
Besides, there's no guarantee that Imari will ever be mine.

[MSG$01A6D7,70]
In that light, doing as Kitami says doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

[MSG$01A722,94]
I can't escape from that pleasure. As long as I obey Kitami, my lust will always be satisfied.

[MSG$01A798,25]
Minase "Are you kidding?"

[MSG$01A7CC,10]
I deny it.

[MSG$01A7DB,49]
Imari and I don't have that kind of relationship.

[MSG$01A819,37]
Kitami "You can't fool me, you know."

[MSG$01A858,111]
Kitami "You may not realize it yourself, but deep down inside, you look upon her as one of the opposite sex..."

[MSG$01A8E1,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$01A8FA,81]
Kitami "But if that's the case, it's convenient for me. That means you don't care

[MSG$01A950,29]
|what happens to her, right?"

[MSG$01A988,70]
If we succeed with the ritual, then you'll be able to sleep with her."

[MSG$01A9E8,69]
Kitami "I'll be happy to return your love, In Imari's body, that is."

[MSG$01AA47,49]
Kitami "Well? It's a pretty good deal, isn't it?"

[MSG$01AA92,29]
At her words, I nod silently.

[MSG$01AABC,39]
True, if Kitami possesses Imari's body,

[MSG$01AAE8,81]
I'll be able to experience the kind of arousal I can only dream about with Imari.

[MSG$01AB3E,59]
Besides, there's no guarantee that Imari will ever be mine.

[MSG$01AB86,70]
In that light, doing as Kitami says doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

[MSG$01ABD1,94]
I can't escape from that pleasure. As long as I obey Kitami, my lust will always be satisfied.

[MSG$01AC3C,31]
Kitami "So it's a deal, right?"

[MSG$01AC75,115]
Kitami "I have high expectations of you. You're going to work hard starting Monday, in preparation for the ritual."

[MSG$01AD02,57]
That's right, today's Saturday...and tomorrow's Sunday...

[MSG$01AD63,39]
Then I realize I have plans with Imari.

[MSG$01AD97,62]
Minase "That's right, I'm supposed to meet Imari on Sunday..."

[MSG$01ADF0,46]
When she hears this, Kitami raises an eyebrow.

[MSG$01AE2B,16]
Kitami "A date?"

[MSG$01AE55,12]
Minase "No!"

[MSG$01AE7B,98]
Kitami "No need to deny it. That'll work out perfectly, If you two are going to be alone together,

[MSG$01AEE2,44]
it might be a good chance to capture her..."

[MSG$01AF28,83]
With that, she takes something out of her pocket, and hands me some kind of tablet.

[MSG$01AF88,23]
Kitami "Give her this."

[MSG$01AFB9,39]
Minase "What kind of medicine is this?"

[MSG$01AFFA,70]
Kitami "It's not poison or anything, it'll just make her fall asleep."

[MSG$01B05A,35]
Kitami "If all goes well, call me."

[MSG$01B097,63]
With that, she hands me a piece of paper with her phone number.

[MSG$01B0E3,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$01B112,29]
I put them both in my pocket.

[MSG$01B13C,29]
Minase "Hey, that's right..."

[MSG$01B173,36]
I tell Kitami about the secret club.

[MSG$01B19C,55]
I tell her that Saeki's invited me to go there tonight.

[MSG$01B1E0,34]
Kitami "Now that's interesting..."

[MSG$01B21C,86]
Kitami "Kaori Saeki, eh? That girl who's been practicing bogus black magic at school?"

[MSG$01B28C,55]
After she hears my story, inspiration seems to hit her.

[MSG$01B2D0,46]
Kitami "All right, why don't I go there, too?"

[MSG$01B318,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$01B33F,74]
Kitami "I'm going with you. I'd like to see what kind of place they have."

[MSG$01B3A3,35]
She smiles boldly as she says this.

[MSG$01B3CB,39]
I'll bet she has some kind of scheme...

[MSG$01B3FF,73]
Kitami "Besides, it might not be a bad idea to make that apartment mine."

[MSG$01B462,79]
Kitami "Those three might come in handy, too. You'll take me there, won't you?"

[MSG$01B4CB,25]
I agree to Kitami's plan.

[MSG$01B4E9,90]
I never intended to get Saeki and the others involved, but at this point I have no choice.

[MSG$01B548,51]
Now those three will be Kitami's servants too, huh?

[MSG$01B588,41]
Kitami "Then let's meet up after school."

[MSG$01B5CB,69]
I make plans to meet up with Kitami later, and leave the infirmary...

[MSG$01B640,15]
April 25 - Roof

[MSG$01B73E,42]
Minase "Did I make them wait a long time?"

[MSG$01B782,93]
After I leave the infirmary I head toward the roof. After all, I've been called out by Inoue.

[MSG$01B7EC,95]
It's a pain in the ass, but unless I show up they might come storming into the classroom again.

[MSG$01B850,39]
I rush up the stairs and open the door.

[MSG$01B884,10]
Door opens

[MSG$01B983,74]
Inoue "You're late, you bastard! How long were you gonna keep us waiting?"

[MSG$01B9E7,108]
Inoue "What the hell, I'll give you credit for not running away. Even knowing that today's the day you die."

[MSG$01BA99,15]
April 25 - Roof

[MSG$01BB27,41]
Minase I shouldn't keep Inoue waiting..."

[MSG$01BB6A,81]
I decide to take care of business with Inoue first. There's still plenty of time.

[MSG$01BBC0,77]
I leave the classroom and go up the stairs to the roof, then I open the door.

[MSG$01BC1A,8]
Click...

[MSG$01BD17,78]
Inoue "There you are, you bastard. I'll give you credit for not running away."

[MSG$01BD7F,50]
Inoue "Even knowing that today's the day you die."

[MSG$01BDCB,79]
As soon as he sees me, Inoue spits this out. This guy I'd humiliated yesterday.

[MSG$01BE1F,83]
He'd sure looked pathetic yesterday, but now he's got a confident smile on his mug.

[MSG$01BE7F,86]
Inoue "You had a lot of balls yesterday. Do you know how much humiliation I suffered?"

[MSG$01BEEF,27]
As if I give a rat's ass...

[MSG$01BF17,96]
Inoue "But today's different. I'm going to humiliate you as much as I was humiliated yesterday!"

[MSG$01BF91,83]
Inoue "Let's see, first I think I'll make you strip naked, and jump off this roof."

[MSG$01BFE9,43]
Don't worry, I'll write your will for you."

[MSG$01C02E,17]
What a dumbass...

[MSG$01C04C,59]
Inoue "Hey, don't try to escape, because you're not gonna."

[MSG$01C0A1,16]
Inoue "Shinjou!"

[MSG$01C129,54]
Inoue yells out, and Shinjou emerges from the shadows.

[MSG$01C16C,16]
Here he comes...

[MSG$01C189,82]
Shinjou "What the hell? This is that girl's little sidekick. You mean you guys got

[MSG$01C1E0,33]
|dissed by this little turd too?"

[MSG$01C21B,70]
Inoue "Haha, well, the punk used some kind of weird technique, see..."

[MSG$01C27B,48]
Inoue forces a smile as he confesses to Shinjou.

[MSG$01C2B8,67]
Shinjou "For chrissake...listen, I'm not your goddamned bodyguard!"

[MSG$01C315,16]
Inoue "Sorry..."

[MSG$01C33F,88]
Shinjou "Whatever. Hey punk, I don't know what technique you used, but I'll take you on.

[MSG$01C39C,19]
Come on, bring it!"

[MSG$01C3C9,72]
Shinjou steps in front of me, brimming with confidence, as he says this.

[MSG$01C41E,73]
Shinjou "What's wrong? Put your fists up, Or are you too scared to move?"

[MSG$01C481,26]
Leering, Shinjou baits me.

[MSG$01C4A0,105]
I'm just standing there motionless, not even getting into position, staring at Shinjou with exasperation.

[MSG$01C516,29]
Minase "I'm ready anytime..."

[MSG$01C54D,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$01C573,50]
Shinjou's fists start to quiver as he looks at me.

[MSG$01C5B2,34]
Shinjou "Don't give me that shit!"

[MSG$01C5EE,34]
With a yell, Shinjou lunges at me.

[MSG$01C61D,17]
Minase "Rasha..."

[MSG$01C648,46]
I summon the demon-servant, to test his power.

[MSG$01C683,14]
Shinjou "Ugh!"

[MSG$01C6AB,92]
In that instant, Shinjou stops in his tracks as if he's being restrained by an unseen power.

[MSG$01C714,76]
Inoue "What's the matter, Shinjou? Aren't you gonna rip that guy to shreds?"

[MSG$01C77A,23]
Shinjou "I know, I am!"

[MSG$01C7AB,107]
Shinjou looks frantic. Of course he does, his body just defied his will. It's not doing his mind's bidding.

[MSG$01C823,89]
Minase "What's wrong? Where'd all your bravado go? Aren't you going to rip me to shreds?"

[MSG$01C896,31]
Shinjou "You shut the fuck up!"

[MSG$01C8CF,70]
In my mind, I bid the demon to take control of the guy in front of me.

[MSG$01C922,23]
Shinjou "Ugh! Augh...."

[MSG$01C953,59]
Shinjou's face contorts in pain, but he refuses to give up.

[MSG$01C993,26]
He's a persistent bastard.

[MSG$01C9BA,52]
Shinjou "Goddamn you...what the hell are you doing?"

[MSG$01CA08,113]
Either Shinjou's got an iron will, or else my power's not sufficient to subdue him, but his resistance continues.

[MSG$01CA7E,55]
It must be a pretty funny scene for Inoue and his gang.

[MSG$01CAC2,48]
We must look like cartoon characters facing off.

[MSG$01CAFF,14]
Shinjou "Ugh!"

[MSG$01CB27,5]
Snap!

[MSG$01CB39,72]
Just then, Shinjou's eyes go dull, and he begins staring off into space.

[MSG$01CB86,27]
He's succumbed to my power.

[MSG$01CBAE,47]
Minase "Sigh...you were pretty tough to crack."

[MSG$01CBF7,13]
Shinjou "..."

[MSG$01CC1E,57]
Shinjou's listening to me with a vacant look in his eyes.

[MSG$01CC64,34]
Minase "The sky's beautiful, huh?"

[MSG$01CCA0,35]
I say this as I look up at the sky.

[MSG$01CCD0,78]
Minase "Don't you think it would feel great if you could fly across that sky?"

[MSG$01CD38,45]
Minase "I think I'd like to watch you fly..."

[MSG$01CD80,22]
Shinjou nods his head.

[MSG$01CDA3,65]
And without hesitation, he stumbles towards the edge of the roof.

[MSG$01CDF1,33]
Inoue "What's going on, Shinjou?"

[MSG$01CE2C,65]
Inoue doesn't know what to make of Shinjou's mysterious behavior.

[MSG$01CE7A,44]
Shinjou "Can't you see I'm a BIRD, jackass?"

[MSG$01CEC0,91]
With that, Shinjou starts flapping his arms, jumps over the railing and leaps into the sky.

[MSG$01CF4C,7]
Whoosh!

[MSG$01CF60,6]
Splat!

[MSG$01CF73,59]
Female Student "Augh! Someone just dropped out of the sky!"

[MSG$01CFC8,47]
Female Student 2 "Somebody, call an ambulance!"

[MSG$01D011,47]
I can hear female voices screeching down below.

[MSG$01D04D,17]
Minase "Jerkwad."

[MSG$01D078,30]
I laugh derisively at Shinjou.

[MSG$01D09B,68]
Inoue's plan failed, Instead it was Shinjou who jumped off the roof.

[MSG$01D0EC,55]
Oh well, there's a nice soft flowerbed where he landed.

[MSG$01D128,68]
Surely a big strong guy like him wouldn't die from a fall like that.

[MSG$01D1B3,13]
Inoue "Augh!"

[MSG$01D1DA,28]
Minase "You wanna fly, too?"

[MSG$01D210,80]
I ask Inoue and his gang this. They look like they're about to piss their pants.

[MSG$01D26D,32]
Inoue "Help...somebody help us!"

[MSG$01D2A7,49]
Minase "Do you swear you'll never defy me again?"

[MSG$01D2F2,73]
Inoue "We swear, we swear! We'll do anything, We're your underlings now!"

[MSG$01D355,33]
Inoue is spluttering frantically.

[MSG$01D383,75]
Minase "Then I'll let you go this time. Don't forget what you just said..."

[MSG$01D3E8,44]
They nod their heads vigorously up and down.

[MSG$01D421,59]
Seeing this, I leave the rooftop with a smile on my face...

[MSG$01D517,53]
I hurry toward the infirmary, where Kitami awaits me.

[MSG$01D5D5,15]
Knock, knock...

[MSG$01D5F1,22]
I knock, just in case.

[MSG$01D614,18]
There's no answer.

[MSG$01D633,14]
The door opens

[MSG$01D64E,30]
I open the door and go inside.

[MSG$01D679,22]
There's no one around.

[MSG$01D694,31]
But I can hear a faint sound...

[MSG$01D6C0,27]
Minase "It's me, Minase..."

[MSG$01D6F5,29]
I call out to the empty room.

[MSG$01D71F,19]
Kitami "Over here."

[MSG$01D74C,71]
I hear Kitami's voice from the back of the room, responding to my call.

[MSG$01D7A0,26]
I walk in that direction..

[MSG$01D7C7,24]
It's where the beds are.

[MSG$01D7EC,71]
I can hear a squishing sound along with heavy breathing from that area.

[MSG$01D838,31]
Apparently, Kitami's not alone.

[MSG$01D864,23]
Minase "What the hell?"

[MSG$01D973,21]
I wince at the sight.

[MSG$01D995,86]
There's a feminine young man on the floor, practically a woman; his pants are down and

[MSG$01D9F0,36]
|you can see the whites of his eyes.

[MSG$01DA21,82]
And there's thick semen, probably expelled by this guy, all over Kitami's clothes.

[MSG$01DA80,74]
Kitami "You're late. But that's all right, since I've just finished here."

[MSG$01DAE4,66]
So saying, Kitami licks away the fresh cum encrusted on her mouth.

[MSG$01DB33,84]
Kitami must've captured the guy with her poison and milked all the semen from him...

[MSG$01DB94,20]
Minase "Is he dead?"

[MSG$01DBC2,41]
I look at the feminine guy as I say this.

[MSG$01DBF8,82]
Kitami "Of course not. He just fainted, I milked every last drop of cum from him."

[MSG$01DC64,71]
With that, she gets dressed, and shoves the unconscious guy into a bed.

[MSG$01DCB0,50]
Then she smiles coolly as though nothing happened.

[MSG$01DD8C,21]
I wince at the sight.

[MSG$01DDAE,41]
Kitami's body is dripping with fresh cum.

[MSG$01DDE4,74]
Kitami "You're late. But that's all right, since I've just finished here."

[MSG$01DE48,60]
So saying, Kitami licks away the cum encrusted on her mouth.

[MSG$01DF30,86]
There's a feminine young man on the floor, practically a woman; his pants are down and

[MSG$01DF8B,36]
|you can see the whites of his eyes.

[MSG$01DFBC,20]
Minase "Is he dead?"

[MSG$01DFEA,41]
I look at the feminine guy as I say this.

[MSG$01E020,82]
Kitami "Of course not. He just fainted, I milked every last drop of cum from him."

[MSG$01E08C,80]
Kitami must've captured him with her poison and milked all the semen from him...

[MSG$01E0E9,69]
With that, she gets dressed, and shoves the unconscious guy into bed.

[MSG$01E133,49]
Then she smiles coolly as though nothing happened

[MSG$01E1DF,20]
April 25 - Classroom

[MSG$01E27A,70]
Lunch is over, and it's time for my boring afternoon class to begin...

[MSG$01E349,27]
...........................

[MSG$01E371,24]
........................

[MSG$01E396,18]
..................

[MSG$01E3B5,12]
............

[MSG$01E3CE,9]
.........

[MSG$01E473,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$01E4C6,37]
Imari "Let's go to our club meeting."

[MSG$01E505,58]
As usual, Imari comes to my desk when the last bell rings.

[MSG$01E54C,57]
Minase "I've got something to do today. I can't make it."

[MSG$01E59F,58]
Imari "There you go again. But you can't fool me anymore."

[MSG$01E5F3,23]
Minase "But it's true."

[MSG$01E624,102]
Imari "You've ditched all this time! If you don't start showing up, you'll never finish your project!"

[MSG$01E6A4,30]
Imari refuses to listen to me.

[MSG$01E6CF,37]
Just then, I'm summoned over the P.A.

[MSG$01E6F9,44]
I'd asked Kitami to arrange that in advance.

[MSG$01E732,25]
Minase "See, I told you."

[MSG$01E765,60]
Imari "All right, I guess I'm going to have to believe you."

[MSG$01E7BB,43]
Even Imari has no choice but to believe me.

[MSG$01E7F3,55]
I say goodbye to Imari, and head towards the infirmary.

[MSG$01E837,20]
April 25 - Apartment

[MSG$01E8E1,78]
After I got to the infirmary, Kitami and I had sex until it was time to leave.

[MSG$01E93C,18]
..................

[MSG$01E95B,9]
.........

[MSG$01E971,58]
And now we're standing in front of the apartment building.

[MSG$01E9B0,25]
We're just about on time.

[MSG$01EA7E,27]
Kitami "This is the place?"

[MSG$01EAB3,13]
Minase "Yes."

[MSG$01EADA,90]
Kitami "Well, it seems like a good place. Out of the way, it's probably sound-proof, too."

[MSG$01EBDF,61]
Kitami and I head towards the room Saeki's coven was renting.

[MSG$01EC21,70]
I wonder what they'll be like when they see I've brought Kitami along.

[MSG$01ED14,70]
We walk down the hall, and stop in front of a door with no name plate.

[MSG$01ED67,10]
Ding dong!

[MSG$01ED7E,60]
I press the doorbell. I can hear it ringing beyond the door.

[MSG$01EDC7,12]
Voice "Yes?"

[MSG$01EDED,49]
I hear a familiar voice coming from the intercom.

[MSG$01EE23,47]
It's Amatsuki, one of the members of the coven.

[MSG$01EE5F,27]
Minase "It's me, Minase..."

[MSG$01EE94,46]
Amatsuki "Hang on, I'll get the door for you."

[MSG$01EEDC,54]
Presently I hear the sound of the door being unlocked.

[MSG$01EF1F,8]
Click...

[MSG$01EFD4,42]
Amatsuki "Welcome! So you came after all!"

[MSG$01F018,47]
Amatsuki invites me in and I follow her inside.

[MSG$01F04C,67]
The room is as dark as usual, and I can barely see where I'm going.

[MSG$01F0CF,34]
Kitami "Excuse me, I'm coming in."

[MSG$01F10B,93]
Kitami slips into the room. She'd followed me inside and had been hidden from view until now.

[MSG$01F175,57]
Amatsuki "Who are...? Minase, you'd better explain this!"

[MSG$01F1C8,43]
Amatsuki is annoyed by the sight of Kitami.

[MSG$01F200,30]
Kitami "What a lovely room..."

[MSG$01F238,50]
Kitami ignores Amatsuki and looks around the room.

[MSG$01F2F4,28]
Kurimoto "Who's that woman?"

[MSG$01F32A,48]
Kurimoto emerges from the back of the apartment.

[MSG$01F35F,45]
She's looking at Kitami with frank suspicion.

[MSG$01F399,66]
I don't know what to say, so all I can do is stand there silently.

[MSG$01F3E8,37]
Amatsuki "Minase brought her here..."

[MSG$01F427,78]
Kurimoto "Minase, don't you know you're not supposed to bring outsiders here?"

[MSG$01F48F,21]
Kurimoto snaps at me.

[MSG$01F4B1,50]
Kitami "Don't be mad at him, I just tagged along."

[MSG$01F4FD,32]
Kurimoto "Then get out of here."

[MSG$01F537,26]
Kurimoto glares at Kitami.

[MSG$01F55E,23]
Amatsuki "Now, Maki..."

[MSG$01F58F,55]
Amatsuki is flustered by Kurimoto's show of aggression.

[MSG$01F5D3,64]
Kurimoto "This isn't just a game, you know... what we're doing."

[MSG$01F62D,57]
Kitami "Oh? I'd like to see this Black Magic of yours..."

[MSG$01F680,52]
Kurimoto "There's nothing to show you. Now get out."

[MSG$01F6CE,49]
Kitami "What a little brat. You're an eyesore..."

[MSG$01F71A,68]
With that, she pushes away Kurimoto, who's standing in front of her.

[MSG$01F804,6]
Thump!

[MSG$01F817,16]
Kurimoto "Augh!"

[MSG$01F8E1,99]
Instantly, Kurimoto flies through the air and bounces off the wall as if thrown by an unseen force.

[MSG$01F951,26]
Kitami "Let's go, Minase."

[MSG$01F985,30]
Amatsuki "Are you okay, Maki?"

[MSG$01F9BD,89]
Kitami ignores Kurimoto, and strides towards the back of the apartment. I rush after her.

[MSG$01FA23,22]
April 25 - Ritual Room

[MSG$01FADC,43]
Saeki "What happened? What was that sound?"

[MSG$01FB21,65]
We go into the back room. Saeki notices our presence immediately.

[MSG$01FB67,58]
Amatsuki has followed us here, and she runs towards Saeki.

[MSG$01FBFF,27]
Amatsuki "You see, Maki..."

[MSG$01FC34,38]
Amatsuki just stands there, flustered.

[MSG$01FC5F,64]
All I can do is watch Kitami. There's no way for me to stop her.

[MSG$01FCDF,59]
Saeki "You're the campus doctor...what are you doing here?"

[MSG$01FD34,53]
Saeki "What's the meaning of this? Explain yourself!"

[MSG$01FD83,55]
Saeki's bewildered, and looks to me for an explanation.

[MSG$01FE18,52]
Kurimoto "Watch out, that one has incredible power!"

[MSG$01FE66,32]
Kurimoto staggers into the room.

[MSG$01FEC6,113]
Kitami "I heard that some students were engaging in suspicious activities, and came to counsel them. How's that?"

[MSG$01FF51,51]
Saeki "It's not like we're prostituting ourselves!"

[MSG$01FF9E,50]
Kitami "It's something worse than prostitution..."

[MSG$01FFEA,68]
With that, Kitami looks down at the magic circle drawn on the floor.

[MSG$02003B,90]
Kitami "This is quite an impressive room...It's a very good magic circle, too. I like it."

[MSG$0200AF,28]
Saeki "What are you saying?"

[MSG$0200E5,40]
Kitami "I'm taking over this apartment."

[MSG$020127,14]
Saeki "What?!"

[MSG$02014F,106]
Kitami "You want to borrow the power of the demons, don't you? If so, then I'll be glad to lend you mine."

[MSG$0201D3,59]
Kurimoto "What do you mean? Are you sure you're not crazy?"

[MSG$020228,88]
Kitami "So you still haven't learned your lesson? Didn't you see what I just did to you?

[MSG$020285,47]
Or do you want me to teach you another lesson?"

[MSG$0202CE,41]
Kurimoto "Grrr...Amatsuki, the talisman!"

[MSG$020395,65]
Amatsuki obeys Kurimoto and takes out a complex-looking talisman.

[MSG$0203E3,56]
Kurimoto "SENAPOS, TERFITA, ESTAMOS, PERFITER, NOTARIN!"

[MSG$020435,48]
Kurimoto takes the talisman and starts chanting.

[MSG$020472,31]
Amatsuki "PARANTHES, HISTANOS!"

[MSG$0204AB,30]
Amatsuki also begins to chant.

[MSG$02055F,8]
(flames)

[MSG$020574,16]
Kurimoto "Whoa!"

[MSG$02059E,16]
Amatsuki "Augh!"

[MSG$0205C8,49]
But both of their charms burst into purple flame.

[MSG$0205FE,44]
Hastily, they both drop them onto the floor.

[MSG$020637,45]
Kitami "Hahaha! A Black Pullet talisman, eh?"

[MSG$02067E,84]
Kitami "But a talisman in the hands of two novices like you won't do a thing to me."

[MSG$0206EC,16]
Kurimoto "Damn!"

[MSG$020716,37]
Kitami "It's my turn, Are you ready?"

[MSG$020755,19]
Saeki "Damn witch!"

[MSG$020782,54]
Saeki jumps in front of Kitami, and positions herself.

[MSG$02084E,27]
Saeki "YOD, HEH, VAV, HEH!"

[MSG$020883,73]
Saeki shouts this out as she draws an invisible pentagram around herself.

[MSG$0208D9,33]
Saeki "Appear before me, Raphael!

[MSG$0208FF,23]
And behind me, Gabriel!

[MSG$02091B,26]
On my right hand, Michael!

[MSG$02093A,28]
And on my left hand, Uriel!"

[MSG$020970,83]
Saeki "A pentagram shall burn around me, and a hexagram shall shine above my head!"

[MSG$0209DD,86]
Kitami "The pentagram barrier field, eh? But do you really see a pentagram around you?

[MSG$020A38,52]
Is there really a hexagram shining above your head?"

[MSG$020A86,48]
So saying, Kitami slowly advances towards Saeki,

[MSG$020ABB,30]
But Saeki doesn't even flinch.

[MSG$020AE6,25]
Saeki "I...I can see it!"

[MSG$020B19,33]
Kitami "There's nothing there..."

[MSG$020BE9,6]
WHACK!

[MSG$020BFC,13]
Saeki "AHHH!"

[MSG$020C63,8]
Thump...

[MSG$020C78,107]
Saeki is slapped across the face at full strength by Kitami, and she falls down on top of the magic circle.

[MSG$020D90,92]
Kitami "If you have any doubts or vulnerabilities, that's what happens to a barrier field...

[MSG$020DF1,50]
In other words, your magic is nothing but a sham."

[MSG$020E3D,15]
Saeki "Grrr..."

[MSG$020E66,40]
Kitami "I'll show what real magic is..."

[MSG$020EA8,22]
Kitami "O Belzebub..."

[MSG$020ED8,53]
Kitami whispers this, then touches each of the girls.

[MSG$020F1A,16]
Amatsuki "Augh!"

[MSG$020F44,16]
Kurimoto "Augh!"

[MSG$020F6E,26]
Saeki "What...what the..."

[MSG$020FA3,60]
All three of them start convulsing, then crash to the floor.

[MSG$020FEC,50]
Kitami "All right, Minase. I need you to help me."

[MSG$021039,50]
I have a pretty good idea what Kitami has in mind.

[MSG$021078,96]
Just as she did to me, she's going to make a physical connection to establish control over them.

[MSG$0210DD,78]
It's true, the fastest way would be to take them over through carnal pleasure.

[MSG$021138,15]
I nod silently.

[MSG$021154,78]
I'm going to have these three girls. Just imagining it is enough to arouse me.

[MSG$0211A7,51]
Not many people would get an opportunity like this.

[MSG$0211E7,50]
Kitami "What about you three? Are you having fun?"

[MSG$021233,65]
Kitami smiles down at the three girls, who are clearly suffering.

[MSG$0212FD,36]
Amatsuki "What's going on? My body!"

[MSG$02133B,35]
Kurimoto "Hot! I'm hot down there!"

[MSG$021378,95]
The girls start groping at their crotches. They're writhing desperately in an effort to escape.

[MSG$0213DC,92]
But apparently they have no strength in their legs, for all they can do is struggle in vain.

[MSG$021445,38]
Saeki "Minase, you've got to save us!"

[MSG$021485,63]
Saeki looks like she's about to cry as she begs me to help her.

[MSG$0214D1,58]
Kitami "It's no use, Minase is going to rape you all now."

[MSG$021525,29]
Saeki "But no! Is that true?"

[MSG$02157C,75]
Minase "Yeah, it's true, I'm gonna screw you. I'll screw you like crazy..."

[MSG$0215E1,71]
I grin lewdly at her, and spit these words out at the struggling Saeki.

[MSG$021635,24]
Saeki "You're insane..."

[MSG$021667,63]
Minase "You'll go insane too, soon enough, from all the fun..."

[MSG$0216CB,51]
Minase "I have no choice. I can't defy Ms. Kitami."

[MSG$021718,65]
I have no expression on my face as I answer the struggling Saeki.

[MSG$021766,46]
Saeki "How can you? Are you out of your mind?"

[MSG$0217AE,77]
Minase "Don't worry. As long as you do as Ms. Kitami says, I won't hurt you."

[MSG$021815,46]
Saeki "So you've sold your soul to the devil!"

[MSG$02185D,19]
Saeki glares at me.

[MSG$02187D,39]
Minase "You'll understand soon enough."

[MSG$0218BE,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$0218D6,50]
Kitami "All right, Minase. Take off your clothes."

[MSG$021922,77]
I obey Kitami and put my hands on my pants, I lower them, and then my shorts.

[MSG$021974,26]
Then I show Saeki my dick.

[MSG$02199B,14]
Amatsuki "No!"

[MSG$0219C3,78]
When she sees my lower body exposed, Amatsuki turns red. But her gaze is on my

[MSG$021A16,8]
|crotch.

[MSG$021A2B,31]
My prick isn't fully erect yet.

[MSG$021A4F,92]
Seeing this, Kitami grabs it and starts giving me a hand job. Soon it's standing up stiffly.

[MSG$021AB8,46]
Kitami "Well, I see you're as virile as ever."

[MSG$021B00,83]
Kitami "Now then, I'll show you mine, too. I'm sure you'll appreciate the sight..."

[MSG$021B6D,102]
With that, Kitami looks at the girls and pulls down the zipper on her back. She discards her clothing.

[MSG$021BD8,58]
She pulls down her panties, and exposes her sexual organs.

[MSG$021CBF,12]
Kitami "Nn!"

[MSG$021CE5,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$021D4F,52]
Just then, something pops out from between her legs.

[MSG$021D90,13]
Minase "Ugh!"

[MSG$021DB7,16]
Amatsuki "Augh!"

[MSG$021DE1,29]
Kurimoto "You...you monster!"

[MSG$021E18,64]
There's a terrifyingly erect penis jutting from Kitami's crotch.

[MSG$021E65,26]
Saeki "A hermaphrodite..."

[MSG$021E99,92]
It's a lot more masculine than your average prick. Veins are bulging out, and it's pulsating

[MSG$021EFA,26]
|in time to her heartbeat.

[MSG$021F21,28]
Kitami "So, do you like it?"

[MSG$021F57,82]
Kitami gazes down at her cock, enraptured, She lovingly strokes the pinkish tip...

[MSG$021FB6,41]
Kitami "Now then, Let's begin, shall we?"

[MSG$021FF9,59]
She grasps her massive cock and advances towards the girls.

[MSG$022039,13]
I follow her.

[MSG$022053,46]
Amatsuki "Keep that dirty thing away from me!"

[MSG$02209B,20]
Kurimoto "Stay away!

[MSG$0220C9,59]
Kitami "If you don't like it, let's see you try to escape."

[MSG$02219B,12]
Saeki "Ugh!"

[MSG$0221C1,86]
Saeki's battering her legs against the floor, but try as she might she can't get away.

[MSG$022224,82]
Kitami "Impossible. Your pussy is so wet, you can't even move your legs, can you?"

[MSG$022290,86]
Kitami "Or maybe it's because you don't want to escape, after seeing this manly cock?"

[MSG$022300,27]
Saeki "No...that's not it!"

[MSG$022335,108]
Kitami "It's not good for you to strain yourself. Either way, you want it so badly you can't wait, can you?"

[MSG$0223BB,101]
Kitami "That kind of excitement can't be quenched until you've had sex over and over and over again."

[MSG$02243A,27]
Saeki "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$02246F,53]
Kitami "The others have reached their limits, I see."

[MSG$0224BE,30]
Amatsuki "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$0224F6,41]
Amatsuki "Augh! Hot! I'm hot down there."

[MSG$022539,44]
Saeki "Hold back...you've got to hold back."

[MSG$02257F,78]
Amatsuki "Penetrate me! I don't care what it is, penetrate me with something!"

[MSG$0225E7,53]
Kurimoto "Augh! Hurry up! Just hurry up and rape me!"

[MSG$022636,52]
The other two have fallen victim to carnal pleasure.

[MSG$02266F,84]
I look over and see that the juice is flowing from their vaginas and onto the floor.

[MSG$0226D0,32]
Saeki "Both of you, get a grip!"

[MSG$02270A,44]
Kitami "Stop fighting and give in yourself!"

[MSG$022750,41]
With that, Kitami strokes Saeki's crotch.

[MSG$0227FF,15]
Saeki "Aaaaah!"

[MSG$022828,22]
Quiver, quiver, quiver

[MSG$02284B,14]
Spraying noise

[MSG$022866,85]
In that instant, Saeki orgasms. A vigorous stream of urine flows through her panties.

[MSG$0228C8,23]
Saeki "Aaaaah! Ohhh..."

[MSG$0228F9,14]
Spraying noise

[MSG$022914,77]
Saeki has a dazed look on her face as she savors the afterglow of her orgasm.

[MSG$022966,57]
She continues to pee until the dazed look becomes vacant.

[MSG$022A25,74]
Kitami "Oh, my. You should be ashamed of yourself for wetting your pants."

[MSG$022A89,58]
Hearing Kitami's words, Saeki turns bright red with shame.

[MSG$022AD0,31]
Kitami "Didn't that feel good?"

[MSG$022B09,28]
Still red-faced, Saeki nods.

[MSG$022B32,47]
Kitami "Then let's enjoy ourselves together..."

[MSG$022B7B,18]
Saeki "All right."

[MSG$022BA7,42]
So even Saeki's just like any other woman.

[MSG$022BDE,91]
Kitami "All right, I'm going to mess around with Saeki, so you take care of the other two."

[MSG$022C53,40]
With that, Kitami jumps on top of Saeki.

[MSG$022D2B,14]
Saeki "Aaaah!"

[MSG$022D53,75]
Kitami takes Saeki into her arms, and thrusts her penis up into her vagina.

[MSG$022DA3,85]
I get even more aroused watching this, and try to satisfy my lust with the two girls.

[MSG$022E81,16]
Amatsuki "Augh!"

[MSG$022EAB,91]
I place Amatsuki on top of Kurimoto.  In this way I can assault them both at the same time.

[MSG$022F0B,38]
Now who should I get a taste of first?

[MSG$022FF5,55]
I leave the two exhausted girls, and go over to Kitami.

[MSG$0230B6,24]
Saeki "Aaaah! Oh! Ahhh!"

[MSG$0230E8,29]
Kitami is still raping Saeki.

[MSG$023112,71]
Her sturdy cock is inserted not in Saeki's vagina, but up her pink ass.

[MSG$02315E,56]
I can hear the sound of it going in and out, in and out.

[MSG$0231A3,84]
I remember reading in one of the books from the library that demons prefer anal sex.

[MSG$023204,61]
Kitami "Are you done with those two? You're as fast as ever."

[MSG$02325B,94]
Kitami snickers, and says this in a confident voice as she continues to rape Saeki up the ass.

[MSG$0232C6,96]
In contrast, Saeki, with her butt corked up roughly by Kitami, is shivering with pleasure as she

[MSG$02332B,37]
|swings her breasts back and forth...

[MSG$02335D,86]
There's a stream of frothy cum, probably expelled by Kitami, running down her body and

[MSG$0233B8,25]
|dripping onto the floor.

[MSG$0233DE,91]
Kitami "Your dick isn't satisfied yet, I see. It's still erect. Would you like to join us?"

[MSG$023453,23]
I nod without thinking.

[MSG$023477,55]
Kitami "Then come here. Let's rape this girl together."

[MSG$0234C8,48]
I grip my prick in my hands and walk up to them.

[MSG$023505,76]
Kitami "Do you want to stick it in here? It's all slimy with my cum, though.

[MSG$023556,56]
See, this cock of mine ejaculates just like a real one."

[MSG$0235A8,59]
So saying, Kitami gestures to Saeki's vagina with her chin.

[MSG$0235E8,69]
True, Saeki's crevice is already overflowing with thick frothy cum...

[MSG$02363A,100]
I don't really like the idea of inserting my prick in a place that's sticky with someone else's cum.

[MSG$0236AB,37]
Kitami "Or you can stick it into me."

[MSG$0236EA,40]
With that, she points to her own vagina.

[MSG$023717,64]
Underneath her masculine cock, she's still got her female parts.

[MSG$023784,59]
I aim at Saeki, and plunge my prick into her slimy crevice.

[MSG$023845,16]
Slither, slither

[MSG$023862,15]
Saeki "Aaaaah!"

[MSG$02388B,74]
As Saeki cries out, the cum that gets pushed out of her vagina by my prick

[MSG$0238DA,30]
|sloshes noisily to the floor,

[MSG$023905,87]
My prick slides easily into her vagina, since Kitami's cum is working like a lubricant.

[MSG$023969,23]
Squish! Squish! Squish!

[MSG$02398D,44]
I gyrate my hips in time to Kitami's rhythm.

[MSG$0239BE,81]
Saeki's sandwiched between us. She's being assaulted from the front and the back.

[MSG$023A1C,108]
Each time Kitami and I thrust our hips, the sound of our three bodies making contact echoes around the room.

[MSG$023A95,41]
Saeki "Augh! Ohhh! Imagine, two at once!"

[MSG$023AD8,54]
Saeki tosses her head, writhing from intense pleasure.

[MSG$023B1B,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$023B41,63]
Slimy with cum, Saeki's vagina is almost unnaturally seductive.

[MSG$023B8D,117]
And since we're both thrusting into her, we can feel each other's cocks through Saeki's vaginal wall. It's new to me.

[MSG$023C0F,54]
Kitami and I thrust at the same time, in perfect sync.

[MSG$023C52,13]
Saeki "Ahhh!"

[MSG$023C79,23]
Saeki moans every time.

[MSG$023C9D,61]
After thrusting into Saeki's slimy vagina, I'm ready to come.

[MSG$023CE7,57]
Kitami's cum might be having an aphrodisiac effect on me.

[MSG$023D2D,34]
Minase "Ms. Kitami...I'm gonna..."

[MSG$023D69,32]
Kitami "I'm about ready, too..."

[MSG$023DA3,72]
Kitami "Since we're finishing up, I'm going to let out every last drop."

[MSG$023E05,57]
She says that to Saeki as she violently gyrates her hips.

[MSG$023E4B,57]
Saeki "Please, don't come with that big thing anymore..."

[MSG$023E9E,35]
Saeki struggles as she begs Kitami.

[MSG$023ECE,44]
Minase "Have you already let out that much?"

[MSG$023F14,53]
Kitami "Three times in the vagina, twice up the ass."

[MSG$023F63,29]
This professor is invincible.

[MSG$023F85,79]
And it must've been torture to receive such massive amounts of cum up her butt.

[MSG$023FE1,19]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$024001,50]
We both accelerate as we get close to ejaculating.

[MSG$024038,62]
Saeki is gasping as she tries to endure our thrusting assault.

[MSG$024083,75]
Saeki "Aaaah! Can't hold it in. I'm gonna come! Both in front and in back!"

[MSG$0240E8,41]
Kitami "I'll expel a lot of juice, dear."

[MSG$02412B,31]
Saeki "I'm coming, I'm coming!"

[MSG$024164,51]
Kitami "We're going to come at the same time, now!"

[MSG$0241B1,24]
I nod at Kitami's words.

[MSG$0241CE,26]
I've reached my own limit.

[MSG$0241F5,20]
Kitami "I'm coming!"

[MSG$024223,20]
Minase "I'm coming!"

[MSG$024343,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$024369,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$024389,87]
Kitami and both thrust our hips at the same time, and expel hot white cum inside Saeki.

[MSG$0243ED,13]
Saeki "Augh!"

[MSG$024414,58]
Saeki is aroused, and writhes in ecstasy as she convulses.

[MSG$02445B,23]
Minase "Augh...augh..."

[MSG$02448C,70]
Both convulsing, Kitami and I continue to shoot off for a long time...

[MSG$0244DF,75]
Saeki "You're coming inside me! I can feel a lot of cum inside my stomach!"

[MSG$024544,101]
Kitami "Lucky you, getting to experience two people coming inside you on both sides at the same time.

[MSG$0245AE,25]
It's a rare opportunity."

[MSG$0245E1,54]
Kitami speaks to Saeki as she continues to emit juice.

[MSG$02461C,63]
At last I'm done, and I withdraw my prick from Saeki's crevice.

[MSG$024668,10]
Slither...

[MSG$0246F8,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$02472E,49]
I withdraw my prick from Saeki, and gasp for air.

[MSG$02476C,8]
Cough...

[MSG$024781,66]
Saeki's crevice is like a hole someone just removed the cork from.

[MSG$0247C8,69]
I don't know if it's mine or Kitami's, but there's cum streaming out.

[MSG$02481A,20]
(sound of streaming)

[MSG$0248B4,15]
Saeki "(sighs)"

[MSG$0248DD,44]
Kitami withdraws her cock from Saeki's anus.

[MSG$024916,120]
Even after she's pulled out her prick, Saeki's anus is still gaping wide open in an unseemly manner, and it's quivering.

[MSG$024993,100]
I can see that the cum that pooled inside her anus is starting to flow outwards in a whitish stream.

[MSG$024A04,14]
Saeki "Uaaah!"

[MSG$024A2C,7]
Whoosh!

[MSG$024A40,73]
Then with a strange noise, Kitami's juice comes whooshing out of her ass.

[MSG$024A96,79]
There must've been a lot pooled inside her, because it sprays out relentlessly,

[MSG$024AEA,80]
like a stream of thick white condensed milk, and gathers in a pool on the floor.

[MSG$024B47,15]
Saeki "(sighs)"

[MSG$024B70,4]
Thud

[MSG$024B81,47]
When it's over, Saeki falls over in exhaustion.

[MSG$024BBD,75]
Kitami "All right, let's take a break and then go on to Round 2, shall we?"

[MSG$024C22,27]
We're going to do it again?

[MSG$024C55,112]
I decide to insert my prick into Kitami. If I'm gonna stick it anywhere, I'd prefer to avoid the sloppy seconds.

[MSG$024CD2,29]
Kitami "All right, go ahead."

[MSG$024D09,108]
I press my prick against Kitami's crevice as she's invited me to do. I thrust my hips forward in one motion.

[MSG$024DFB,11]
Slither.,..

[MSG$024E13,34]
My prick slides inside her easily.

[MSG$024E42,15]
Kitami "Mmm..."

[MSG$024E6B,27]
As usual, it's a tight fit.

[MSG$024E8B,92]
But it's a lot more lively down there today, probably because she's being aroused both ways.

[MSG$024EF4,23]
Squish, squish, squish!

[MSG$024F18,33]
I sync myself to Kitami's rhythm.

[MSG$024F46,57]
I thrust into Kitami, and then Kitami thrusts into Saeki.

[MSG$024F84,108]
Each time Kitami and I thrust our hips, the sound of our three bodies making contact echoes around the room.

[MSG$024FFD,40]
Saeki "Ahhh....ohhh...it feels so good!"

[MSG$02503F,54]
Saeki tosses her head, writhing from intense pleasure.

[MSG$025082,40]
Each time we thrust, her breasts jiggle.

[MSG$0250B7,57]
The three of us are like a daisy chain as we thrust away.

[MSG$0250FD,83]
Kitami "Ohhh...ahhh...amazing. It feels amazing to rape someone while being raped!"

[MSG$02516A,37]
She says this with a look of rapture.

[MSG$025194,95]
Since she's experiencing both male and female pleasure at the same time, it's got to feel good.

[MSG$025200,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$025226,55]
Each time Kitami thrusts, her vagina squeezes my prick.

[MSG$025262,49]
I'm writhing from the pleasure of that sensation.

[MSG$0252A0,90]
Perhaps because Kitami's more aroused than usual, that tightness is the ultimate pleasure.

[MSG$0252FF,54]
Kitami and I thrust at the same time, in perfect sync.

[MSG$025342,13]
Saeki "Ahhh!"

[MSG$025369,23]
Saeki moans every time.

[MSG$025385,103]
Each time Kitami's massive cock goes in and out, Saeki's anus gapes so wide it looks like it might rip.

[MSG$0253F9,83]
I've been thrusting inside Kitami's tight vagina, and in no time I'm ready to come.

[MSG$025459,34]
Minase "Ms. Kitami...I'm gonna..."

[MSG$025495,50]
As I thrust into her, I speak in a pathetic voice.

[MSG$0254CC,56]
I'm impressed that I can still come after already having

[MSG$025509,24]
|expelled so much juice.

[MSG$02552E,32]
Kitami "I'm about ready, too..."

[MSG$025568,84]
Kitami "Just a few more moments. I'm so aroused, I think I've got a lot to let out!"

[MSG$0255D6,33]
So saying, Kitami licks her lips.

[MSG$025604,20]
Saeki "Aaaah! Ohhh!"

[MSG$025632,57]
Saeki "Please don't come anymore! My stomach's all full!"

[MSG$025685,32]
Saeki, still writhing, protests.

[MSG$0256B2,44]
Minase "Have you already let out that much?"

[MSG$0256F8,53]
Kitami "Three times in the vagina, twice up the ass."

[MSG$025747,29]
This professor is invincible.

[MSG$025771,19]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$025791,50]
We both accelerate as we get close to ejaculating.

[MSG$0257C8,52]
Saeki is gasping as she tries to endure our assault.

[MSG$025809,67]
Saeki "Aaaah! Can't hold it in. I'm gonna come! My ass is on fire!"

[MSG$025866,41]
Kitami "I'll expel a lot of juice, dear."

[MSG$0258A9,65]
Kitami "Minase, make sure you spray a lot of cum inside me, too."

[MSG$025904,31]
Saeki "I'm coming, I'm coming!"

[MSG$02593D,22]
I've reached my limit.

[MSG$025958,49]
At roughly the same time, all three of us climax.

[MSG$025996,20]
Minase "I'm coming!"

[MSG$025AB6,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$025ADC,67]
I plunge my prick deep inside Kitami's vagina, and come inside her.

[MSG$025B2C,20]
Kitami "I'm coming!"

[MSG$025B5A,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$025B7A,81]
Kitami thrusts her hips at the same time, and expels a spray of cum inside Saeki.

[MSG$025BD8,16]
Saeki "Aaaaaah!"

[MSG$025C02,58]
Saeki is aroused, and writhes in ecstasy as she convulses.

[MSG$025C49,23]
Minase "Augh...augh..."

[MSG$025C7A,65]
Both convulsing, Kitami and I continue to come for a long time...

[MSG$025CC8,79]
Saeki "You're coming inside me! I can feel a lot of hot cum inside my stomach!"

[MSG$025D31,63]
Kitami "I can feel Minase coming inside me, too! It's so much!"

[MSG$025D8A,70]
Kitami is experiencing both male and female pleasure at the same time.

[MSG$025DD5,53]
She has a look of rapture on her face the whole time.

[MSG$025E17,17]
Quiver...spurt...

[MSG$025E35,58]
At last I'm finished, and I withdraw my prick from Kitami.

[MSG$025E7C,10]
Slither...

[MSG$025F0C,28]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$025F42,8]
Cough...

[MSG$025F57,110]
Kitami's crevice is like a hole someone just removed the cork from. Rivers of hot white cum are streaming out.

[MSG$025FD2,83]
Kitami "That's a lot of cum...I could get pregnant even if it's a safe day for me."

[MSG$02603F,35]
Kitami "Oh well, who am I to talk?"

[MSG$02607C,20]
(sound of streaming)

[MSG$026116,16]
Saeki "Aaaaaah!"

[MSG$026140,44]
Kitami withdraws her cock from Saeki's anus.

[MSG$026179,119]
Even after she's pulled out her cock, Saeki's anus is still gaping wide open in an unseemly manner, and it's quivering.

[MSG$0261F5,100]
I can see that the cum that pooled inside her anus is starting to flow outwards in a whitish stream.

[MSG$026266,14]
Saeki "Uaaah!"

[MSG$02628E,7]
Whoosh!

[MSG$0262A2,73]
Then with a strange noise, Kitami's juice comes whooshing out of her ass.

[MSG$0262F8,79]
There must've been a lot pooled inside her, because it sprays out relentlessly,

[MSG$02634C,80]
like a stream of thick white condensed milk, and gathers in a pool on the floor.

[MSG$0263A9,15]
Saeki "(sighs)"

[MSG$0263D2,4]
Thud

[MSG$0263E3,47]
When it's over, Saeki falls over in exhaustion.

[MSG$02641F,75]
Kitami "All right, let's take a break and then go on to Round 2, shall we?"

[MSG$026484,27]
We're going to do it again?

[MSG$0264C1,18]
April 25 - Baptize

[MSG$026569,30]
We wallow in lust endlessly...

[MSG$026594,108]
Inside this bizarre room, I immerse myself in these lewd acts. I'm covered in the scent of incense and sweat

[MSG$026605,25]
|and our bodily fluids...

[MSG$02662B,48]
And after a long time, we finally reach the end.

[MSG$0266EC,7]
Thud...

[MSG$026700,96]
Kitami tosses the body of Saeki, who she's been screwing constantly all this time, to the floor.

[MSG$02676D,22]
Saeki "Ahhh...ahhh..."

[MSG$02679D,78]
Saeki's eyes are vacant. She quivers as a stream of saliva runs down her chin.

[MSG$0267F8,98]
After repeated sex, all three of the girls are exhausted and they're all lying prone on the floor.

[MSG$02685F,15]
Like corpses...

[MSG$026873,89]
But as proof that they're still alive, their chests rise and fall with their breathing...

[MSG$0268D9,56]
The juice is flowing from their vaginas and their asses.

[MSG$026916,67]
Proof that Kitami and I both screwed them all until they fainted...

[MSG$026966,47]
Kitami "Now we're going to purify your bodies."

[MSG$0269AF,51]
Kitami "Minase, make sure you spray a lot on them."

[MSG$0269FC,35]
I'm already on the brink of coming.

[MSG$026A24,60]
Because Kitami's been making me hold back for a while now...

[MSG$026A6D,19]
Pump, pump, pump...

[MSG$026A8D,104]
As we look down on the three girls laid out in a row on the floor, Kitami and I start pumping our cocks.

[MSG$026B02,56]
Kitami "I hereby baptize the three of you in my name..."

[MSG$026B54,84]
Kitami "Our Father, who art in heaven...Acknowledge the act that I now engage in..."

[MSG$026BC2,85]
As she whispers, Kitami draws an inverted cross across her chest with her right hand.

[MSG$026C24,17]
Minase "Uaaah..."

[MSG$026D41,22]
Spurt...Spurt...splat!

[MSG$026D64,25]
I climax before she does.

[MSG$026D82,75]
My back is arched as I spray hot cum on the girls' bodies, over and over...

[MSG$026DDA,22]
Splat, splat, splat...

[MSG$026DFD,55]
The three girls receive my stream of juice in a daze...

[MSG$026E41,28]
Minase "Ah...ahhh...ohhh..."

[MSG$026E77,22]
Spurt...Spurt...splat!

[MSG$026E9A,26]
Minase "(heavy breathing)"

[MSG$026F47,69]
I ejaculate for the umpteenth time today, and collapse in exhaustion.

[MSG$026F99,58]
I've lost count of how many times I've gotten off today...

[MSG$026FE0,80]
Even with the help of Kitami's power, I've reached my physical and mental limit.

[MSG$027035,56]
I bet a normal person would've died of fatigue by now...

[MSG$02707A,87]
Kitami "Oh my, have you already come, Minase? How insolent of you to come before I do."

[MSG$0270EB,44]
Pumping her own cock, Kitami snickers at me.

[MSG$02711C,72]
If I continue this relationship with Kitami, I'm not going to last long.

[MSG$027171,50]
Kitami "All right...Now, then, I'm about ready..."

[MSG$0271BE,49]
With that, Kitami accelerates her pumping action.

[MSG$0271F4,86]
The added friction causes a stream of clear fluid to emerge from the tip of her prick.

[MSG$027257,45]
Kitami "Now make sure you catch all of this!"

[MSG$02729E,66]
The girls on the floor just lie there, waiting to receive her cum.

[MSG$0272ED,18]
Kitami "Aaaaaaah!"

[MSG$027319,91]
Kitami grunts, then shudders violently. She expels a massive amount of juice from her cock.

[MSG$02740A,20]
Spurt, Spurt, splat!

[MSG$02742B,19]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$02744B,62]
The thick, heavy cum splatters noisily onto the girls' bodies.

[MSG$027496,78]
The cock milk splashes onto their faces, their mouths, and even their breasts.

[MSG$0274F1,14]
Splash, splat!

[MSG$02750C,86]
After she's relieved herself of most of her cum, she pumps out the rest with her hand.

[MSG$02756F,30]
Kitami "Ahh...that was a lot."

[MSG$027620,59]
She sighs deeply and says this with a look of satisfaction.

[MSG$027660,70]
Now that we're done, there's a heady aroma of sex permeating the room.

[MSG$0276B3,108]
Kitami "Starting today, you three are my servants. If you obey me, I'll give you the most amazing pleasure."

[MSG$027739,36]
Saeki "Thank...thank you very much."

[MSG$027777,33]
Saeki says this in a faint voice.

[MSG$02779D,71]
It was at this moment when the secret room fell under Kitami's control.

[MSG$0278DD,8]
Click...

[MSG$0278F2,77]
I'm intensely fatigued, I open the door and stumble into the hall to go home.

[MSG$027944,80]
The air outside is cold, I look at my watch and see that it's almost midnight...

[MSG$0279A1,49]
The others are asleep, Kitami is taking a shower.

[MSG$0279DF,54]
I'm not in the mood to shower, so I decide to go home.

[MSG$027A1A,37]
Right now I just want to go to bed...

[MSG$027A4C,46]
I stick my hands in my pockets and start home.

[MSG$027B03,60]
I've got the key to this secret club apartment in my pocket.

[MSG$027B44,42]
That room is now Kitami's, starting today.

[MSG$027B7B,69]
I turn up my collar, and start walking home along the dark streets...
