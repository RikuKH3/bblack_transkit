[MSG$0001E0,13]
Talk to Murai

[MSG$000212,21]
Try using it yourself

[MSG$000244,19]
Ugh, don't touch it

[MSG$00027C,32]
Why don't I just go for Imari...

[MSG$0002B9,36]
Of course, the Idol of the school...

[MSG$000302,34]
In that case, just go for Imari...

[MSG$000349,28]
Refuse in no uncertain terms

[MSG$000382,48]
For now just pretend to go along like a good boy

[MSG$0003D7,19]

Transformation spell

[MSG$000440,11]
Take a peek

[MSG$000470,16]
Keep on watching

[MSG$00049D,13]
Stop watching

[MSG$0004CF,19]
I try simulating it

[MSG$000507,8]
Save her

[MSG$00052C,42]
Start plotting a different way to use this

[MSG$00057B,16]
Punish those two

[MSG$00077A,18]
April 22 - Morning

[MSG$000812,19]
Voice "Wake up...."

[MSG$00083F,26]
Voice "Please, wake up..."

[MSG$000873,25]
Voice "Come on, wake up!"

[MSG$0008A6,60]
Somewhere in my drowsy haze, I can hear an angel whispering.

[MSG$0008E7,48]
The angel seems even more kind than usual today.

[MSG$00091C,43]
Though who knows how long that will last...

[MSG$0009E5,54]
Imari "If you don't get up right now, you'll be late!"

[MSG$000A35,30]
Imari "Come on, now, wake up!"

[MSG$000A6D,45]
Imari "It's Imari, asking you pretty please!"

[MSG$000AB4,13]
That moron...

[MSG$000ACE,100]
When I hear that voice, so unlike the Imari I know, I can't help laughing ruefully, even in my daze.

[MSG$000B37,78]
She might think she's being gentle, but it's actually scarier for me this way.

[MSG$000B92,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$000BAA,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$000C3A,43]
Imari "Oh, man! I don't believe this crap!"

[MSG$000C7F,52]
Imari "You're giving me the chills, for God's sake."

[MSG$000CCD,76]
With that, the real Imari returns. I'm a lot more comfortable with this one.

[MSG$000D26,100]
Imari "All right, I was going to wake you up gently, but I can see you're determined not to get up!"

[MSG$000DA4,45]
Imari "I hope you know what you're in for..."

[MSG$000DEB,20]
Imari "Here I go..."

[MSG$000E19,31]
Imari "Sandwich pin technique!"

[MSG$000E52,5]
Thud!

[MSG$000EDD,98]
Just at that moment, it seems as though my body has levitated...and then the whole world capsizes.

[MSG$000FE1,18]
Wham! Crash! Thud!

[MSG$001000,69]
The next thing I know, I'm squashed between the bed and the mattress.

[MSG$001052,63]
Imari has knocked over the whole mattress, with me still on it.

[MSG$00109E,4]
Bam!

[MSG$00114E,50]
Minase "I can't believe you woke me up like that!"

[MSG$00119A,83]
I shove the mattress away and yell at Imari, who stands impassively in front of me.

[MSG$0011F2,50]
Can't she come up with something better than that?

[MSG$001231,53]
Imari "Using force is the most effective, after all."

[MSG$001280,58]
Imari nods her head, satisfied, as she makes this comment.

[MSG$0012BF,57]
But as the victim, I find this tactic totally screwed up.

[MSG$001305,83]
Minase "Jeez...on top of being sleep-deprived, that was the rudest awakening ever!"

[MSG$001372,74]
It looks like I burned out in the middle of translating the book of magic.

[MSG$0013C9,68]
I can remember up to a point, but not the moment when I fell asleep.

[MSG$001412,72]
I'm impressed with myself for somehow making it under the covers myself.

[MSG$001467,75]
I look over and see that my notes and books are scattered all over my desk.

[MSG$0014BF,50]
Imari "I bet you were up late again last night..."

[MSG$00150B,62]
Imari "That's why I'm always telling you to get to bed early!"

[MSG$001563,79]
Minase "Just shut up, will you? Don't start lecturing me the second I wake up!"

[MSG$0015CC,58]
I mutter and complain as I start changing into my uniform.

[MSG$00160B,38]
Imari quickly averts her eyes from me.

[MSG$001662,30]
Imari "Hey, what's this book?"

[MSG$00169A,88]
Imari is interested in the book on my desk. She asks me about it as I'm getting dressed.

[MSG$0016F7,86]
The Book of Magic, which I'd been reading until late last night, was there on my desk.

[MSG$00175A,19]
Minase "It's porn."

[MSG$001787,37]
I answer her curtly as I get dressed.

[MSG$0017B1,73]
Even if Imari took a look inside there's no way she'd be able to read it.

[MSG$001807,48]
Imari "You're just messing with me, aren't you?"

[MSG$001851,72]
Imari speaks with suspicion in her voice as she flips through the pages.

[MSG$0018A6,39]
Imari "I have no idea what it's about."

[MSG$0018E7,26]
Imari "You can read this?"

[MSG$00191B,25]
Minase "You think I can?"

[MSG$00194E,40]
Imari "Probably not with your brains..."

[MSG$001990,45]
Imari "But where'd you get a book like this?"

[MSG$0019D7,31]
Minase "I'm just borrowing it."

[MSG$001A10,49]
Imari "Even though you can't read it? And anyway,

[MSG$001A46,75]
who'd lend you a book like this? I'm pretty sure it belongs in a museum..."

[MSG$001AAB,38]
Imari "Oh, wait, is it Yukiko's book?"

[MSG$001AEB,68]
This probably occurred to Imari because she knows my sister so well.

[MSG$001B3C,29]
Minase "Something like that."

[MSG$001B73,107]
I can't stand being interrogated about every little thing, so I just tell Imari this to stop her questions.

[MSG$001BEB,16]
Imari "I see..."

[MSG$001C15,35]
Imari is still staring at the book.

[MSG$001C45,26]
Minase "You can look now."

[MSG$001C79,41]
I get myself ready and call out to Imari.

[MSG$001CA7,32]
Imari hears me and turns around.

[MSG$001D06,28]
Imari "All right, let's go."

[MSG$001D3C,86]
I stuff my notes between the pages of the book, place it in my bag and leave the room.

[MSG$001D9F,26]
April 22 - Going to school

[MSG$001E44,68]
Imari "Are you that sleepy? You've got to get to bed early tonight."

[MSG$001EA2,51]
Imari says this to me because I can't stop yawning.

[MSG$001EE2,16]
Minase "Yawn..."

[MSG$001F0C,41]
Instead of replying, I yawn at her again.

[MSG$001F42,43]
Imari "Oh, come on! That's your 21st yawn."

[MSG$001F87,60]
The little pest, is she counting how many times I've yawned?

[MSG$001FD0,116]
Imari "Really, now, Minase...you're never gonna be able to get up on time when you start working in the real world!"

[MSG$00205E,29]
Imari sighs as she says this.

[MSG$002080,38]
As if that were any of her business...

[MSG$0020B3,18]
April 22 - Lockers

[MSG$002167,33]
Imari "Mika's absent today, huh?"

[MSG$0021A2,83]
Imari is looking over at Ito's locker with a worried look as she changes her shoes.

[MSG$002202,45]
A pair of indoor shoes sit inside her locker.

[MSG$00223C,47]
Minase "Maybe she just hasn't gotten here yet."

[MSG$002285,89]
That's what I tell her, but I don't think there's a chance in hell that Ito will show up.

[MSG$0022E3,86]
After what happened, no one in their right mind could possibly show their face here...

[MSG$00234E,20]
April 22 - Classroom

[MSG$0023E1,14]
The door opens

[MSG$0023FC,50]
Imari and I open the door and enter the classroom.

[MSG$00246D,61]
Imari "Hey, I guess you and I are the first ones here today."

[MSG$0024C5,54]
For once, there's no one else in the classroom but us.

[MSG$002508,20]
April 22 - Classroom

[MSG$002543,64]
I head toward my seat and hang up my bag on the side of my desk.

[MSG$002588,57]
Since the Book of Magic's inside, it hangs there heavily.

[MSG$0025CE,15]
The door opens.

[MSG$00261C,59]
Kaori Saeki is the next person after Imari and I to appear.

[MSG$002664,51]
Saeki glides over to her seat like she always does,

[MSG$00269C,73]
sits down quietly and takes her textbooks and other books out of her bag.

[MSG$002716,52]
After a while, a few more of our classmates show up.

[MSG$002757,102]
Some of them start discussing Ito, while others get to work on the homework they've forgotten to do...

[MSG$002846,64]
In the midst of all this, Saeki sits at her desk reading a book.

[MSG$002893,53]
I get up from my seat, and walk towards Saeki's desk.

[MSG$0028D5,66]
Minase "What are you reading? The book you checked out yesterday?"

[MSG$002931,58]
I try to start a conversation with Saeki to pass the time.

[MSG$002970,44]
Normally, I probably wouldn't talk to Saeki,

[MSG$0029A1,83]
but after yesterday's incident I find myself more aware of her presence than usual.

[MSG$002A01,94]
Besides, ever since I got my hands on that book, I have more than a passing interest in Saeki,

[MSG$002A64,35]
as a fellow black magic enthusiast.

[MSG$002A94,78]
If it's just a matter of knowledge, I know that Saeki is far superior to me...

[MSG$002AE7,56]
But knowledge and experience are two different things...

[MSG$002B2C,33]
Saeki "A book of poems by Yeats."

[MSG$002B67,87]
Saeki looks up at me with her usual expression, and answers me in an unemotional voice.

[MSG$002BCB,15]
Minase "Yeats?"

[MSG$002BF4,52]
It's the book Saeki had in her hands at the library.

[MSG$002C2D,60]
I could see the name ''W.B. Yeats'' on the cover, all right.

[MSG$002C76,68]
Saeki "William Butler Yeats. An Irish poet who won the Nobel Prize."

[MSG$002CD4,62]
Minase "Poetry, huh? You're more of a romantic than you look."

[MSG$002D2C,115]
That was just my honest opinion. But I guess maybe people who call themselves magicians are all romantics in a way.

[MSG$002DAC,110]
Milton's Paradise Lost, Goethe's Faust. Both are about the Devil, and they portray him in an aesthetic manner.

[MSG$002E27,26]
But to tell you the truth,

[MSG$002E46,80]
|I thought it would be more fitting to see Saeki reading her black magic book to

[MSG$002E9B,53]
|the sounds of death metal music, rather than poetry.

[MSG$002EDD,107]
Saeki "Yeats was an occultist, you know. At one time he was the president of the Order of the Golden Dawn."

[MSG$002F62,33]
I'd just read in one of the books

[MSG$002F88,92]
|I'd borrowed yesterday that the Golden Dawn was an occult order that included such renowned

[MSG$002FE9,35]
|occultists as Mathers and Crowley.

[MSG$003019,63]
All right, that made sense. Saeki didn't let me down after all.

[MSG$00305D,88]
I'm sure she was going to tell me that her favorite bands were Napalm Death and Carcass.

[MSG$003161,61]
Murai "Hey, you're going to do my reading today, aren't you?"

[MSG$0031B9,93]
At that moment, Motoko Murai appears suddenly, practically shoving me aside to talk to Saeki.

[MSG$003223,60]
Apparently it's Murai's turn to have her reading done today.

[MSG$003264,62]
After what happened yesterday, it's pretty thoughtless of her.

[MSG$0032AF,70]
Saeki "Sorry, I've decided not to do any more readings for a while..."

[MSG$00330F,50]
Saeki turns down Murai's request with these words.

[MSG$00334E,83]
Clearly, she's decided to stop because she feels bad about what happened yesterday.

[MSG$0033A6,61]
|Even if it meant she'd been right, that kind of result would

[MSG$0033E8,38]
|kill the ardor of any fortune-teller.

[MSG$00341B,113]
Not only that, but there was some gossip going around that Saeki's reading had somehow caused the whole incident.

[MSG$003499,62]
Murai "Whaaat, but you told me you'd do my reading yesterday!"

[MSG$0034F1,63]
Murai "Hey, come on, please! I really don't know what to do..."

[MSG$00354A,40]
Saeki "That might be true, but still..."

[MSG$00358C,25]
Murai "Come on...Please!"

[MSG$0035BF,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$0035D7,84]
Saeki "All right, then. I did promise you, so I guess I'm going to have to keep it."

[MSG$003645,83]
Saeki concedes to Murai's relentless pushing, and takes out her cards from her bag.

[MSG$0036A5,15]
Murai "Thanks!"

[MSG$00374A,53]
Saeki "So what kind of reading do you want me to do?"

[MSG$003799,32]
Murai "My love life, of course!"

[MSG$0037D3,36]
Saeki "That never changes, does it?"

[MSG$003811,75]
Murai "The guy is Asada in Class 2. You know who I'm talking about, right?"

[MSG$003876,103]
Murai "I'm trying to decide whether or not I should tell him how I feel about him...what do you think?"

[MSG$0038F7,37]
Saeki "All right, I'll look into it."

[MSG$0039BF,76]
Saeki shuffles the cards and starts laying them out according to the spread.

[MSG$003A10,93]
After scrutinizing the cards on her desk, Saeki looks at Murai with a stern look on her face.

[MSG$003A7A,13]
Murai "Well?"

[MSG$003AA1,24]
Saeki "It's not good..."

[MSG$003AD3,34]
Murai "Really? I had a feeling..."

[MSG$003B0F,50]
Saeki points to a card in front of her and speaks.

[MSG$003B4E,60]
Saeki "This card represents the present. The inverted moon."

[MSG$003BA4,44]
Saeki "He already has a girlfriend, you see.

[MSG$003BD5,99]
In fact they have such a close relationship that there's simply no room for you to move in on him."

[MSG$003C52,14]
Murai "I see."

[MSG$003C7A,54]
I can tell from Murai's reaction that Saeki was right.

[MSG$003CBD,30]
Saeki points to the next card.

[MSG$003CE8,80]
Saeki "This card shows what will happen to you if you embark on such an action."

[MSG$003D52,92]
Saeki "Inverted power...Apathy coexists...he will be absolutely indifferent to your actions.

[MSG$003DB3,63]
At this rate, you'll never be anything more than just friends."

[MSG$003E0C,92]
Saeki continues to point to her cards. Finally she points to the last one, the results card.

[MSG$003E75,81]
Saeki "And this card indicates the final outcome. The Hanged Man, right-side-up."

[MSG$003EE0,84]
Saeki "Even in combination with the other cards, there's no chance of a good result.

[MSG$003F39,51]
This card means that there's nothing you can do..."

[MSG$004025,22]
Murai "It can't be..."

[MSG$004055,86]
Saeki "You'd better not pursue this. All of the cards are against your taking action."

[MSG$0040C5,76]
Saeki "But even if you decide to tell him anyway, I'm not going to stop you.

[MSG$004116,93]
A reading is just a reading...sometimes it will come true, and other times it will be wrong."

[MSG$00418D,90]
Murai "Listen. Isn't there any way you could use your black magic to tear those two apart,

[MSG$0041EC,34]
or make him fall in love with me?"

[MSG$004228,57]
Murai is begging Saeki as if she were a god or something.

[MSG$004266,70]
Or maybe in this case I should say she's a demon, rather than a god...

[MSG$0042B9,93]
Saeki "That won't be possible. It's true that some types of magic are used for such purposes.

[MSG$00431B,52]
But there's no guarantee it would work, and besides,

[MSG$004354,50]
I'm the one who'd have to take on all the risk..."

[MSG$0043A0,64]
Murai "Well, in that case, can't you just show me how to do it?"

[MSG$0043FA,99]
Saeki "No. Magic isn't to be trifled with by amateurs who have no knowledge of what they're doing."

[MSG$004477,27]
Murai "You're just stingy!"

[MSG$0044AC,45]
Murai whirls around, turning away from Saeki.

[MSG$0044E6,65]
Unfazed by Murai, Saeki quickly gathers up the cards on her desk.

[MSG$004534,72]
I'd been quietly watching the whole interaction between Murai and Saeki.

[MSG$004589,53]
Saeki's explanation made sense, all right. But still,

[MSG$0045C3,73]
I had my doubts about whether or not she had that level of magical power.

[MSG$004619,41]
I wasn't anything close to Saeki's level,

[MSG$004647,92]
but I couldn't deny the fact that I was gradually starting to believe in the power of magic.

[MSG$0046B0,74]
Since Saeki had a taste for black magic, she probably knew a spell or two.

[MSG$004707,97]
But I had an urge to find out if the spell I'd mastered was more powerful than whatever she knew.

[MSG$00476D,76]
I was pretty sure that even Saeki didn't have a book like the one I'd found.

[MSG$0047C6,109]
Even though I knew I shouldn't go there, I was overcome by the desire to knock the wind out of Saeki's sails.

[MSG$004838,65]
Saeki and her whole I'm-a-magician act was really pissing me off.

[MSG$004886,32]
She wasn't even that powerful...

[MSG$0048B3,86]
Now might be a good time to let Saeki glimpse my power, and intimidate her a little...

[MSG$004916,84]
Luckily, there was a romance-related spell in the section I'd translated last night.

[MSG$00496F,78]
It would be perfect for proving whether or not the book of magic was for real.

[MSG$0049CA,103]
And plus, if I could get Murai on my side as a witness, I'd be able to show Saeki how powerful I was...

[MSG$004A36,45]
It would be killing two birds with one stone.

[MSG$004A70,12]
All right...

[MSG$004A9F,53]
I speak to Murai, who's still begging Saeki for help.

[MSG$004AE1,62]
Minase "Hey, I can try helping you out with that if you want."

[MSG$004B6B,21]
Murai "What? Really?"

[MSG$004B9A,73]
Murai is taken aback by my sudden offer of help, and tries to confirm it.

[MSG$004BF0,41]
Murai "You can do that, Minase? But how?"

[MSG$004C33,38]
Minase "Just like Saeki...with magic."

[MSG$004C74,37]
I turn towards Saeki when I say this.

[MSG$004C9E,47]
She's looking at me with suspicion in her eyes.

[MSG$004D0C,75]
Saeki "Minase, you really shouldn't take on something like that on a whim."

[MSG$004D71,97]
Saeki "Besides, what do you hope to accomplish? Have you been influenced by those library books?"

[MSG$004DEC,55]
She's dismissing me flat out, and I get a little angry.

[MSG$004E30,105]
She's just too self-assured, as if there can't possibly be anyone else but her with that kind of ability.

[MSG$004E9E,56]
Don't think you're the only one who knows about magic...

[MSG$004EE3,67]
Minase "Hey, I bet I can at least do a better job than you, Saeki."

[MSG$004F40,32]
I say this to Saeki point-blank.

[MSG$004F6D,42]
Saeki "I don't know what you intend to do,

[MSG$004F9C,100]
but don't think you can do anything just because you read a book with some pathetic level of power."

[MSG$00501A,42]
Minase "Just shut up and watch, will you?"

[MSG$005082,94]
I say this and go back to my seat. I take out my notes from the book of magic from last night.

[MSG$0050ED,46]
I select the page containing a relevant spell.

[MSG$005120,33]
And I start preparing to cast it.

[MSG$005180,64]
Imari "What do you think you're doing, Minase? Imitating Saeki?"

[MSG$0051DA,53]
Imari catches sight of what I'm doing and approaches.

[MSG$00521C,47]
Minase "Keep your mouth shut, will you, Imari?"

[MSG$005265,52]
Imari "Well, how dare you leave me out of the loop?"

[MSG$00532F,98]
I borrow scissors and a sheet of paper from Murai, and start cutting the paper into a human shape.

[MSG$005396,37]
Then I lay the paper doll on my desk.

[MSG$0053C0,44]
Saeki watches silently, her eyes suspicious.

[MSG$0053F9,50]
Minase "Okay, now prick your finger with a needle,

[MSG$005430,79]
and write the first letter of the guy's name in your blood on this paper doll."

[MSG$005499,50]
Murai "What, do I have to do something like that?"

[MSG$0054E5,53]
Minase "If you don't want to, we can stop right now."

[MSG$005534,30]
Murai "All right, I'll do it."

[MSG$00556C,118]
Murai pricks her index finger with the tip of a safety pin, and writes down a letter on the paper doll with her blood.

[MSG$005678,26]
Murai "Is this all right?"

[MSG$0056AC,45]
Minase "That's fine. All right, let's begin."

[MSG$0056F3,70]
I take the paper doll from her, and utter the following words over it.

[MSG$005746,35]
Minase "O Uvall, Amon, Astaroth..."

[MSG$005783,39]
And then I lay it back down on my desk.

[MSG$0057B7,68]
I take a deep breath, and recite the words I wrote down in my notes.

[MSG$005808,76]
Minase "Come ye forth, Oriens, Regent of the East. Boul, Regent of the West.

[MSG$005859,71]
Amemon, Regent of the South. And finally, Eltzen, Regent of the North."

[MSG$0058BB,68]
Minase "I charge thee in secret, in the name of the Almighty Adonai,

[MSG$005904,78]
to answer my liege's demands, that thy spirit shall enter this doll herewith."

[MSG$00596C,93]
Minase "ELOHI, ELOHIM, ELOHEI, SABAOTH, ELION, ISCHIROS, ADONAI, JAH, TETRAGRAMMATON, SADAI!"

[MSG$0059E3,10]
Saeki "?!"

[MSG$0059FA,76]
Kaori Saeki is dumbfounded after having watched me complete all these tasks.

[MSG$005A4B,54]
Seeing the look on her face, I'm filled with smugness.

[MSG$005A8E,56]
I'll bet Saeki never dreamed I'd use this kind of magic.

[MSG$005AD3,81]
I continue to intone the spell, and when I've done everything I'm supposed to do,

[MSG$005B29,51]
I take a deep breath and hand Murai the paper doll.

[MSG$005C10,99]
Minase "That's it. Now all you have to do is take this and hide it in the guy's shoe or something."

[MSG$005C8D,54]
Murai "For real? You mean my wish will come true now?"

[MSG$005CDD,24]
Minase "Probably, yeah."

[MSG$005D0F,119]
I can't really be sure. But if this doesn't work, then it will mean that that book has no power. For me, it's a gamble.

[MSG$005D8B,92]
If nothing comes of this, I'll have set myself up for ridicule. But I don't care either way.

[MSG$005DF4,42]
Murai "I'm going to try it out right now."

[MSG$005E38,23]
Murai "Thanks, Minase!"

[MSG$005E69,48]
After thanking me, Murai rushes out of the room.

[MSG$005ECA,43]
Minase "So what did you think of my magic?"

[MSG$005F0F,43]
I look straight at Saeki as I ask her this.

[MSG$005F79,11]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$005F91,53]
Saeki "Where did you learn to cast a spell like that?

[MSG$005FCB,67]
I really don't think it's from reading those books in the library."

[MSG$006028,45]
Minase "Well, hey...I don't really remember."

[MSG$00606F,60]
Saeki "Didn't you tell me that you didn't believe in magic?"

[MSG$0060C5,84]
Minase "It was just a diversion for me. I'm pretty indecisive about things, anyway."

[MSG$006133,110]
Saeki "Even so, you can't expect to get results after blindly performing a ceremony. Magic's not that simple."

[MSG$0061BB,98]
Saeki "There are complex rituals and protocols to follow...only then can you accomplish anything."

[MSG$006237,69]
Minase "Aren't you saying that because you're still just a beginner?"

[MSG$006296,15]
Saeki "Grrr..."

[MSG$0062E3,79]
I go back to my seat, humming a little to myself as I catch a glimpse of Saeki,

[MSG$006337,48]
who's practically biting her lip in frustration.

[MSG$006374,94]
Man, it feels so good. I'd never seen that cool-as-a-cucumber Saeki look so frustrated before.

[MSG$0063D7,52]
Now if that spell works, it'll be the coup de grace.

[MSG$00644A,70]
Imari "If you get her hopes up with that stunt you just pulled...well,

[MSG$006495,54]
don't come running to me if she trashes you later on."

[MSG$0064E5,89]
Imari, who'd been watching my exchange with Murai, says this with a sigh of exasperation.

[MSG$00654B,24]
Minase "Oh, just watch."

[MSG$00657D,57]
Actually, I'm not even sure myself if it's going to work.

[MSG$0065BB,70]
Just because the first spell worked didn't mean that the second would.

[MSG$00660E,62]
But anyway, there was nothing I could do now but wait and see.

[MSG$006659,16]
April 22 - Lunch

[MSG$0066D2,21]
.....................

[MSG$0066F4,12]
............

[MSG$00670D,6]
......

[MSG$0067A4,11]
Luchtime...

[MSG$0067BC,17]
Thud, thud, thud!

[MSG$0067DA,110]
I'm just sitting there at my desk looking off into space as usual, when Murai suddenly comes running up to me.

[MSG$006887,34]
Murai "Minase! Thank you so much!"

[MSG$0068C3,74]
As soon as the words are out of Murai's mouth, Saeki turns to stare at me.

[MSG$006912,110]
Murai has an elated smile on her face as she thanks me over and over, practically throwing her arms around me.

[MSG$00698D,66]
Minase "Hey, calm down, will you? What the hell happened, anyway?"

[MSG$0069E9,89]
Murai "Just listen to me! Thanks to you, everything turned out just great with that guy!"

[MSG$006A5C,90]
Murai "I thought it was hopeless, but what an unexpected twist after you cast that spell!"

[MSG$006AD0,37]
Minase "Well, good for you, I guess."

[MSG$006B0F,79]
Murai's excitement is kind of overwhelming, and that's all I can manage to say.

[MSG$006B63,56]
But I never thought the spell would take hold so fast...

[MSG$006BA8,92]
Murai "Well, listen to this! Just now, I happened to pass him in the hall, and all of sudden

[MSG$006C09,103]
|he told me that he was in love with me! Before I could even tell him how I felt! It was unbelievable."

[MSG$006C8A,117]
Murai "And that's not all! His girlfriend was right next to him, but he blurted it out anyway! Can you believe that?"

[MSG$006D19,70]
Murai "I never saw anyone look as stunned as she did! Pretty pathetic,

[MSG$006D64,50]
huh? Getting dumped in front of all those people?"

[MSG$006DB0,79]
Murai "I can't believe what an evil woman I am...My own beauty terrifies me..."

[MSG$006E19,83]
Murai has an enthralled look on her face. She's totally in her own world right now.

[MSG$006E79,22]
Minase "Hey, Murai..."

[MSG$006EA9,59]
Murai "Oh no you don't, Minase! No use falling for me too!"

[MSG$006EFE,107]
Murai "Oh, but to think that once again, I've bewitched a man. O God in heaven, please forgive me my sins."

[MSG$006FA7,24]
So saying, Murai leaves.

[MSG$006FC4,55]
She's so overjoyed it must've driven her over the edge.

[MSG$00703A,80]
Saeki "Congratulations, Minase. You must be feeling pretty good about yourself."

[MSG$0070A4,80]
After Murai leaves, Kaori Saeki comes up to me to deliver this sarcastic remark.

[MSG$0070F9,48]
But I can clearly see the hostility in her eyes.

[MSG$007136,84]
Minase "Hey, that was nothing, really. I mean, it could've just been a coincidence."

[MSG$0071A4,22]
I answer her modestly.

[MSG$0071BF,41]
Because I know that'll be more effective.

[MSG$0071F5,70]
Saeki "Grr...Of course it was! It could only have been a coincidence!"

[MSG$007279,64]
Saeki hurls this last remark at me, and flounces away in a huff.

[MSG$0072C6,89]
She's pretty shaken up, all right. She's always so cool-headed, and yet here she was now,

[MSG$007324,35]
irrational and baring her emotions.

[MSG$007386,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$00739E,30]
I feel someone's cold stare...

[MSG$0073C1,53]
Next thing I know, Imari's standing right next to me.

[MSG$007403,33]
Minase "What do you want, Imari?"

[MSG$00743E,18]
Imari "Nothing..."

[MSG$00746A,89]
That's what she says in reply, but Imari's eyes are like knives, boring right through me.

[MSG$0074D0,46]
Minase "If you have something to say, say it."

[MSG$007518,76]
Imari "Well, I hate to kinda splash cold water on your proud moment, but..."

[MSG$00757E,73]
Imari "I don't know, that kind of thing just doesn't sit well with me..."

[MSG$0075E1,26]
Minase "What do you mean?"

[MSG$007615,90]
Imari "You know, trying to manipulate another person's feelings with a curse like that..."

[MSG$007689,62]
Imari "It's really in poor taste, even if it was just a joke."

[MSG$0076E1,37]
How rude of her to call it a curse...

[MSG$007713,115]
Imari "Anyway, try not to get too caught up in weird stuff, will you? Everyone's gonna start looking at you funny."

[MSG$0077A0,109]
Imari "If they start seeing you as some kind of freak, that'll make me the best friend of a freak, you know."

[MSG$007828,38]
Minase "Well, thanks for the warning."

[MSG$00789D,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$0078B4,66]
Just then the bell rang, signaling the beginning of my next class.

[MSG$0078FB,63]
At the same time, our classmates start shuffling into the room.

[MSG$007947,36]
I sit at my desk and start to think.

[MSG$0079F4,43]
Really, the book's power is unbelievable...

[MSG$007A24,52]
Now there is no question that its power is for real.

[MSG$007A65,89]
Yesterday's incident...and what happened just now...They were both undeniably my doing...

[MSG$007ACB,75]
Absolute power...So people's destinies can actually be twisted so easily...

[MSG$007B23,45]
After witnessing all this before my own eyes,

[MSG$007B55,95]
I can understand why those girls from 12 years ago got so obsessed with demons and black magic.

[MSG$007BB9,67]
Since I can feel myself getting more and more drawn to it myself...

[MSG$007C09,113]
Still, while some of us revel in the effects of this magic, there are also victims who are suffering from them...

[MSG$007C87,73]
Even so, if used effectively, this was a highly attractive power to have.

[MSG$007CDD,10]
Hold on...

[MSG$007CEC,100]
It's not like I have to use it on others...I could just as easily use it for my own personal profit.

[MSG$007D5D,37]
If I were to use this magic myself...

[MSG$007D8F,66]
That's it. If I use it, then I can have any beautiful girl I want.

[MSG$007DD6,60]
A man's dream come true. No way am I not gonna try this out.

[MSG$007E1F,119]
For better or for worse, I don't have a girlfriend...Actually, there is just one person who might fit that description.

[MSG$007E9B,113]
But there's nothing between Imari and me. We're just childhood friends. Here's the evidence: we've never done it!

[MSG$007F39,53]
All right, why don't I give this power a spin myself?

[MSG$007F73,54]
Farewell, lonely days. And hello, springtime of youth!

[MSG$007FB6,56]
Okay, that's decided. Now who should I cast my spell on?

[MSG$008032,31]
Really, why should I hold back?

[MSG$00805E,73]
If I'm going after anybody, it should be the most popular girl on campus.

[MSG$0080AC,76]
And that's Rika Shiraki, No. 1 on all the guys' ''Want to Sleep With'' list.

[MSG$0082BA,113]
She's brilliant, beautiful and stylish; and on top of that her dad's an executive at a major electronics company.

[MSG$008330,28]
I've heard that she lives in

[MSG$008351,82]
|a huge mansion. She's a young woman of impeccable breeding, no question about it.

[MSG$0083A8,60]
She's in a different class than a certain girl called Imari.

[MSG$0083F1,58]
But I've never even spoken to Shiraki until the other day.

[MSG$008438,85]
She might have been out of my league once, but now I have the power to make her mine.

[MSG$00849A,69]
I don't remember hearing that she's been dating anyone in particular.

[MSG$0084E4,84]
She's not like those lowly girls around her...neither in breeding nor in upbringing.

[MSG$008545,69]
This might be my chance to become the first guy she's ever been with!

[MSG$008688,39]
Minase "Hey, I've got no time to lose!"

[MSG$0086C9,55]
I get up from my seat and start to leave the classroom.

[MSG$00873F,66]
Imari "Where do you think you're going? The first bell just rang."

[MSG$00879B,28]
Minase "I'll be right back."

[MSG$00884D,67]
That's what I tell her as I leave the room. I head toward the roof.

[MSG$008895,48]
I'm pretty sure there won't be anyone there now.

[MSG$0088D2,64]
Farewell Imari...At last I can cut these unsavory ties to you...

[MSG$00891F,113]
Now that I think about it, it might have been because you were always around that I could never get a girlfriend.

[MSG$008995,54]
You only have yourself to blame, you know. Ha, ha, ha!

[MSG$0089D8,67]
I rush up the stairs to the roof, with laughter brimming inside me.

[MSG$008A36,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$008A5C,37]
On second thought, I think I'll pass.

[MSG$008A86,83]
Just think what'll happen if I start dating someone. Imari will be sure to shun me.

[MSG$008AE6,48]
As a matter of fact, she might even get jealous.

[MSG$008B1B,66]
And if that happens, how the hell am I gonna get up every morning?

[MSG$008B6A,23]
That just can't happen.

[MSG$008B8E,7]
Hmmm...

[MSG$008D8D,31]
That's actually a great idea...

[MSG$008DB9,55]
If I can use magic to make Imari mine to boss around...

[MSG$008DF5,94]
Imari will do whatever I say...she won't be able to resist me...she'll be just like a slave...

[MSG$008E8D,24]
And that would be ideal!

[MSG$008EB2,86]
Imari as she is right now holds no excitement for me, and she's not the type I go for.

[MSG$008F0D,39]
So if I just change her to my liking...

[MSG$008F41,46]
Every morning she'll wake me up with a kiss...

[MSG$008F74,79]
Wait, or else we could go to bed together everyday...that might not be too bad.

[MSG$008FD0,49]
We'll be naked together, my skin touching hers...

[MSG$009006,71]
And then we'd wake up and go to school together. Like a married couple!

[MSG$00905A,78]
Before any of that can happen, we do have to go to the next level as lovers...

[MSG$0090B5,7]
Hmmm...

[MSG$0090C9,47]
Sex with Imari...I've never even considered it.

[MSG$009105,98]
Since Imari likes dogs and is an animal-lover in general, maybe she'll like doing it doggie-style.

[MSG$00916C,101]
I'll verbally assault her by saying ''You bitch!'' and keep ramming her from behind, over and over...

[MSG$0091D6,59]
I'd better get hold of a choke collar and a tail for her...

[MSG$00921E,59]
Wait, or maybe I'll have more fun ''house-breaking'' her...

[MSG$009266,72]
I could lash her mercilessly with a whip and drip candle wax onto her...

[MSG$0092B3,111]
Oh, and let's not forget rope! I'll bind her up like a hunk of boneless ham, and then kick the hell out of her.

[MSG$00932F,92]
Since I'm always getting it from her, it's going to feel great to get back at her like that.

[MSG$009390,35]
Ha, ha, ha...how cool will that be?

[MSG$0094B1,39]
Minase "Hey, I've got no time to lose!"

[MSG$0094F2,55]
I get up from my seat and start to leave the classroom.

[MSG$009568,66]
Imari "Where do you think you're going? The first bell just rang."

[MSG$0095C4,28]
Minase "I'll be right back."

[MSG$009676,67]
That's what I tell her as I leave the room. I head toward the roof.

[MSG$0096BE,48]
I'm pretty sure there won't be anyone there now.

[MSG$0096FB,69]
Just you wait, Imari. Starting tomorrow, you're going to be my slave.

[MSG$009745,11]
Ha, ha, ha!

[MSG$00975D,67]
I rush up the stairs to the roof, with laughter brimming inside me.

[MSG$0097AD,18]
April 22 - Rooftop

[MSG$009846,37]
At this hour, there's no one up here.

[MSG$009878,31]
Minase "Okay, no one's around."

[MSG$0098B1,64]
I make sure I'm alone, and then start preparing for my ceremony.

[MSG$0098FE,109]
First I cut out a paper doll, like I just did now, take a safety pin from my pocket, and pierce my fingertip.

[MSG$009970,78]
At the same time I scrawl out an initial with my blood, then intone the spell.

[MSG$0099CB,93]
Minase "ELOHI, ELOHIM, ELOHEI, SABAOTH, ELION, ISCHIROS, ADONAI, JAH, TETRAGRAMMATON, SADAI!"

[MSG$009A42,96]
I'm able to finish the spell efficiently. I grip the piece of paper I've just imbued with power.

[MSG$009AAF,21]
Minase "I'm all set."

[MSG$009ADE,45]
Minase "Now I just have to give this to her."

[MSG$009B25,73]
I think about the rosy future that awaits me, and I can't help but smile.

[MSG$009B73,45]
Long live Black Magic! If this spell works...

[MSG$009BAD,78]
I lose myself in images of what's to come, then leave the roof, half-skipping.

[MSG$009CB3,65]
When I return to the classroom, the teacher still hasn't arrived.

[MSG$009CF9,94]
I'm pretty much out of breath, probably because I ran all the way back. I head toward my seat.

[MSG$009D96,26]
Imari "Where've you been?"

[MSG$009DCA,25]
Minase "Nowhere special."

[MSG$009DFD,75]
I take the piece of paper from my pocket, making sure Imari doesn't see me.

[MSG$009E4D,30]
And I stare at her in silence.

[MSG$009E78,70]
Imari "What...what is it? Is there something on my face or something?"

[MSG$009ED8,45]
Minase "You've got a nose hair sticking out."

[MSG$009F51,21]
Imari "What? No way!"

[MSG$009F80,90]
Hearing this, Imari grabs a little mirror from her bag, and frantically searches her face.

[MSG$009FE7,34]
Imari "Where? Where? Where is it?"

[MSG$00A023,66]
Without missing a beat, I place the paper doll inside Imari's bag.

[MSG$00A0A4,44]
Imari "Come on, there isn't anything there!"

[MSG$00A0EA,96]
Imari yells at me, taking her eyes off the mirror. Looks like she didn't notice what I just did.

[MSG$00A157,51]
Minase "Sorry, sorry. You know I was just kidding."

[MSG$00A1A4,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00A250,80]
Imari "I don't believe you! Besides, I don't have any hairs in my nose, anyway!"

[MSG$00A2BA,52]
Imari is spitting the words out at me, her face red.

[MSG$00A2FB,33]
Imari "Look, the teacher's here!"

[MSG$00A336,53]
I look over just as the teacher enters the classroom.

[MSG$00A378,32]
I start to head back to my desk.

[MSG$00A3A5,40]
Minase "Don't fall in love with me now."

[MSG$00A3E7,32]
That's my parting shot to Imari.

[MSG$00A414,74]
Imari "As if I would, moron! Do you have some kind of fever or something?"

[MSG$00A49C,75]
Ha, ha...this is the last day you'll be able to dare speak to me like that.

[MSG$00A4EC,66]
You don't even know that tomorrow, you'll be groveling at my feet.

[MSG$00A53B,61]
I rub my cheek where Imari slapped me. I can't stop smirking.

[MSG$00A57D,63]
Seeing me in this state, the girl next to me looks creeped out.

[MSG$00A657,65]
When I return to the classroom, the teacher still hasn't arrived.

[MSG$00A6A5,94]
I'm pretty much out of breath, probably because I ran all the way back. I head toward my seat.

[MSG$00A742,31]
Imari "Where were you, anyway?"

[MSG$00A77B,17]
Minase "Nowhere."

[MSG$00A7A6,37]
I feel the paper doll in my pocket...

[MSG$00A7D8,67]
Now I just have to stick this in Rika Shiraki's bag after school...

[MSG$00A828,52]
If I recall, Shiraki belongs to the brass band club.

[MSG$00A861,92]
She won't be going home right after class. I've got plenty of time to set my plan in motion.

[MSG$00A8FC,35]
Imari "What are you leering about?"

[MSG$00A939,37]
I realize that Imari's glaring at me.

[MSG$00A96B,46]
Minase "Nothing, I'm not leering at anything."

[MSG$00A9B3,82]
Imari "Don't give me that. You were thinking of something perverted, weren't you?"

[MSG$00AA1F,87]
Since Imari and I have such a long history, she can always tell when I'm up to no good.

[MSG$00AA7B,40]
Not only that, but she's way perceptive.

[MSG$00AAA8,56]
In other words, she can see right through me every time.

[MSG$00AAED,52]
Minase "What's it to you anyway, what I'm thinking?"

[MSG$00AB3B,48]
Minase "Besides, Imari, you're a big girl now...

[MSG$00AB70,67]
Stop hanging around me all the time and find yourself a boyfriend.'

[MSG$00ABFF,69]
Imari "You...you jerk! Who are you to say something like that to me?"

[MSG$00AC5E,58]
Imari "You'd never get anything done if it wasn't for me!"

[MSG$00ACB2,32]
Imari is red-faced and shouting.

[MSG$00ACDF,50]
Why the hell is she tripping? I was only joking...

[MSG$00AD16,119]
Oh well, I won't have to listen to her tirades for much longer. If the spell works, then it's ''so long Imari'' for me.

[MSG$00AD92,69]
All I need is that book, and I can have any girl at my beck and call.

[MSG$00ADE4,37]
Imari "Okay, the teacher's here now."

[MSG$00AE23,69]
I look over and see that the teacher is just coming through the door.

[MSG$00AE75,16]
Minase "See ya."

[MSG$00AEC3,20]
I return to my seat.

[MSG$00AEE4,54]
Imari "How dare you say that to me...you dense moron!"

[MSG$00AF34,23]
April 22 - After School

[MSG$00AFB4,21]
.....................

[MSG$00AFD6,12]
............

[MSG$00AFEF,6]
......

[MSG$00B013,10]
Bell rings

[MSG$00B0E0,72]
Imari "Okay, school's out...Of course you're coming to the club meeting,

[MSG$00B12D,52]
aren't you? Actually, you're coming no matter what."

[MSG$00B17B,79]
The final bell rings, and Imari comes over to me as I'm getting ready to leave.

[MSG$00B1D7,90]
Needless to say, I have no choice. I could say no, or I could try to lie my way out of it,

[MSG$00B236,44]
but she's determined to drag me there today.

[MSG$00B267,75]
Since I ditched yesterday, I don't have a chance of escaping again today...

[MSG$00B2E2,16]
Minase "No way."

[MSG$00B30C,28]
Imari "Uh-uh. Unacceptable."

[MSG$00B342,36]
Minase "No way, I don't want to go."

[MSG$00B380,15]
Imari "Denied."

[MSG$00B3A9,55]
Minase "What a tyrant, I have my rights too, you know!"

[MSG$00B3FA,38]
Imari "No, you don't have any rights!"

[MSG$00B43A,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$00B453,50]
Apparently, there's no way she's going to give in.

[MSG$00B492,29]
I come up with a secret plan.

[MSG$00B4BC,19]
(Pondering...DING!)

[MSG$00B59E,62]
I grab Imari by the hand, and drag her into the hall by force.

[MSG$00B5E9,58]
Imari "Hey, hey...wait a minute! Where are you taking me?"

[MSG$00B63D,23]
Now we're face to face.

[MSG$00B661,24]
Imari "What's going on?"

[MSG$00B693,34]
Minase "I really like you, Imari."

[MSG$00B6CF,16]
(Grabbing Imari)

[MSG$00B6EC,66]
I grab Imari by the shoulders, and stare into her eyes. Seriously.

[MSG$00B76D,43]
Imari "Huh?! What's this, all of a sudden?"

[MSG$00B7B2,39]
Minase "Come on, just close your eyes."

[MSG$00B7F3,34]
Imari "What for? What's going on?"

[MSG$00B82F,102]
Imari has no idea what just hit her. She looks like a pigeon that just got blasted with a pea-shooter.

[MSG$00B8A2,42]
Minase "Never mind, just close your eyes."

[MSG$00B8E6,17]
Imari "O-Okay..."

[MSG$00B911,16]
(Heart pounding)

[MSG$00B92E,83]
Imari blushes as she nods her head. I can feel her heart pounding beneath my hands.

[MSG$00B98E,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$00B9A6,65]
As soon as I see Imari close her eyes, I put my plan into action.

[MSG$00B9F4,19]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$00BA14,14]
Imari "Mmm..."

[MSG$00BA3C,11]
Imari "..."

[MSG$00BA54,47]
Female student "Excuse me, what are you doing?"

[MSG$00BA9D,27]
Imari "Huh? Where'd he go?"

[MSG$00BAD2,12]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$00BAF8,57]
Imari opens her eyes. Red-faced, she looks around wildly.

[MSG$00BB3E,27]
Imari "Whaaaat? He's gone!"

[MSG$00BB73,59]
Imari "There was a guy standing right here, where'd he go?"

[MSG$00BBC8,85]
Imari grabs the girl who just spoke to her, and shakes her as she asks this question.

[MSG$00BC2A,72]
Female student "Huh? Oh, I saw him racing away at top speed just now..."

[MSG$00BCBE,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$00BCE4,32]
Imari "I'm going to kill him..."

[MSG$00BD38,56]
Minase "All right, all right. I just have to go, right?"

[MSG$00BD8A,69]
Imari "As long as that's clear...Now then, shall we? Vice President?"

[MSG$00BE88,86]
So saying, Imari grips me by the arm, and starts heading briskly towards the Art Room.

[MSG$00BEEB,16]
(dragging sound)

[MSG$00BF08,16]
(dragging sound)

[MSG$00BF25,48]
Imari "Come on, walk a little faster, will you?"

[MSG$00BF6F,31]
Female student "Um, excuse me?"

[MSG$00BFA8,25]
Imari "What do you want?"

[MSG$00BFDB,58]
Female student "I was just wondering where we're going..."

[MSG$00C02F,58]
Imari "What do you mean, where? The Art Room, of course--"

[MSG$00C083,13]
Imari "HUH?!"

[MSG$00C0AA,109]
Imari whirls around and realizes with horror that she's gripping the hand of a student she doesn't even know.

[MSG$00C124,42]
Imari "Who...who are you? Where's Minase?"

[MSG$00C168,30]
Female student "I don't know!"

[MSG$00C1A0,80]
The girl who's been dragged through the hall by Imari tilts her head helplessly.

[MSG$00C22F,25]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$00C255,79]
Imari "I'm going to kill him! When in the world did he change places with her?"

[MSG$00C3CB,93]
I've escaped Imari's clutches and I'm making my leisurely way down the hall, headed for home.

[MSG$00C435,116]
I know I'm screwing Imari over, but there just isn't a good enough reason for me to immerse myself in club meetings.

[MSG$00C4AE,22]
Once a week is enough.

[MSG$00C4C9,96]
After all, the only benefit of being in a cultural-type club is no one really cares if you skip.

[MSG$00C536,61]
Besides, soon enough Imari won't be able to rebel against me.

[MSG$00C578,84]
And when that happens, I'll be free of Imari's control...free to do whatever I want.

[MSG$00C5D9,89]
If I had nothing better to do, I guess I wouldn't mind going along with Imari's crap, but

[MSG$00C637,65]
|unfortunately, I'm not going to have much free time on my hands.

[MSG$00C685,85]
I hurry toward the gates. If I dawdle, there's a chance Imari could capture me again.

[MSG$00C6E7,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00C791,27]
Nonogusa "Stop it, please!"

[MSG$00C7C6,58]
Kobayashi "That's enough! Just be quiet and come with me."

[MSG$00C81A,50]
Female Student "The captain wants to talk to you!"

[MSG$00C866,69]
Just then, I hear voices. Some girls are headed my way from the hall.

[MSG$00C8B8,48]
I see two girls dragging a third girl with them.

[MSG$00C8ED,59]
And this girl is trembling like a frightened little kitten.

[MSG$00C935,79]
The girl has on a swimsuit. Apparently all three of them are swim team members.

[MSG$00C991,36]
Our school has a heated indoor pool,

[MSG$00C9BA,64]
and the swim team is one of the most active of our school clubs.

[MSG$00C9FF,77]
But the pool's next door to the gym. They're going in the opposite direction.

[MSG$00CA59,92]
Could this be a form of hazing? I knew there was a lot of that going around in some clubs...

[MSG$00CAC2,50]
I realize I know the girl they're dragging away...

[MSG$00CAF9,28]
Her name is Miyuki Nonogusa.

[MSG$00CB22,95]
We were in the same class back in high school. I used to bully her too, calling her ''Noguso''.

[MSG$00CB86,37]
(Noguso is someone who shits outside)

[MSG$00CBB8,82]
Probably because of her personality, she often falls prey to that sort of cruelty.

[MSG$00CC17,79]
The snotty girl torturing Nonogusa is Shinobu Kobayashi, the swim team captain.

[MSG$00CC6B,90]
She's a straight-A student. In other words, one of the super show-off girls in our school.

[MSG$00CCD2,71]
She's accompanied by swim team members wherever she goes.  She's a smug

[MSG$00CD1E,23]
|nasty witch of a girl.

[MSG$00CD3A,75]
I wonder if the other girl with her is just one of the members of the team.

[MSG$00CD92,45]
I start watching them and what they're doing.

[MSG$00CDCC,32]
Kobayashi "Come on, get inside."

[MSG$00CE06,16]
Nonogusa "Augh!"

[MSG$00CE54,66]
The girls open the door to a classroom, and shove Nonogusa inside.

[MSG$00CE9B,29]
Then they slam the door shut.

[MSG$00CEC5,104]
I want to know what's going on, so I stand in front of the door, and try to hear what's going on inside.

[MSG$00D0BD,69]
Now that I've evaded Imari, I head towards' Rika Shiraki's classroom.

[MSG$00D10F,14]
The door opens

[MSG$00D1A6,30]
The classroom is empty by now.

[MSG$00D1C9,54]
I enter the room and start looking for Shiraki's desk.

[MSG$00D20C,50]
I look at the name tags on the backs of each seat.

[MSG$00D24B,22]
Minase "Here it is..."

[MSG$00D27B,83]
I go over to Shiraki's desk and place the paper doll from my pocket inside her bag.

[MSG$00D2DB,56]
Now all I have to do is wait for the effects to kick in.

[MSG$00D320,25]
Voice 1 "Please stop it!"

[MSG$00D353,37]
Voice 2 "Shut up! Just come with us."

[MSG$00D392,50]
Female Student "The captain wants to talk to you!"

[MSG$00D3DE,69]
Just then, I hear voices. Some girls are headed my way from the hall.

[MSG$00D430,25]
Uh-oh, somebody's coming!

[MSG$00D44E,72]
This room is at the end of the hall. No question, they're headed here...

[MSG$00D4A3,73]
I jump inside the storage locker for cleaning supplies, next to the door.

[MSG$00D4F1,51]
It's a tight fit, but there's nowhere else to hide.

[MSG$00D5CA,12]
Door opening

[MSG$00D5E3,83]
At the same moment that I go into hiding, the uninvited guests enter the classroom.

[MSG$00D643,44]
Sigh...They really came at the worst time...

[MSG$00D67C,37]
April 22 - Brutal Assault on Nonogusa

[MSG$00D6A4,22]
Voice 1 "No! Stop it!"

[MSG$00D6D4,23]
Voice 2 "Just shut up!"

[MSG$00D705,53]
Voice 1 "What do you mean by this? Bringing me here?"

[MSG$00D754,56]
Voice 1 "If we don't hurry, we'll be late for practice."

[MSG$00D7A7,70]
Voice 3 "Who cares about practice? Can't you do as your captain says?"

[MSG$00D808,116]
From inside the classroom, I can hear desks and chairs being tossed around, and the loud voices of the girls inside.

[MSG$00D889,28]
It all seems very ominous...

[MSG$00D8AA,50]
No way is this your average friendly club meeting.

[MSG$00D9DF,46]
I quietly slide open the door and peer inside.

[MSG$00DA1A,120]
The room is empty, except for the two girls in the corner, both ganging up on a third girl. They're clearly abusing her.

[MSG$00DA97,31]
Girlfights are a scary thing...

[MSG$00DAC3,41]
Nonogusa "But what did I ever do to you?"

[MSG$00DB06,54]
Kobayashi "What you did to me? You know exactly what!"

[MSG$00DB56,77]
Nonogusa "No, I don't. I don't remember ever doing anything to deserve this!"

[MSG$00DBD8,86]
The third girl is trembling like a frightened little kitten as she speaks these words.

[MSG$00DC3B,50]
I realize I know the girl they're dragging away...

[MSG$00DC7A,41]
The girl they're hazing is Yuki Nonogusa.

[MSG$00DCA8,64]
She has a swim suit on, she was probably on her way to practice.

[MSG$00DCF5,111]
We were in the same class back in high school. I used to bully her too, calling her ''Noguso the Booger Girl''.

[MSG$00DD69,37]
(Noguso is someone who shits outside)

[MSG$00DD9B,64]
I used to take part in bullying her too, calling her ''Noguso.''

[MSG$00DDE8,79]
The snotty girl torturing Nonogusa is Shinobu Kobayashi, the swim team captain.

[MSG$00DE44,98]
She's such an angel in front of the teachers, but a completely ruthless bitch without an audience.

[MSG$00DEAB,42]
I can't stand people who are so two-faced.

[MSG$00DEE2,61]
I wonder if the other girl is just a member of the swim team.

[MSG$00DF2C,90]
Kobayashi "I hear you're going to represent our school in the next meet. Congratulations."

[MSG$00DFA0,67]
Kobayashi fixes Nonogusa with a cruel stare as she starts to speak.

[MSG$00DFE8,73]
Nonogusa is trembling with fear. Like a frog who's being eyed by a snake.

[MSG$00E03E,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$00E059,59]
Kobayashi "You must really be feeling good about yourself."

[MSG$00E0AE,16]
Nonogusa "No..."

[MSG$00E0D8,47]
Kobayashi "How does it feel to have beaten me?"

[MSG$00E121,52]
Nonogusa "Oh, please, I don't feel that way at all."

[MSG$00E16F,116]
Kobayashi "Oh? Really now? So I guess I'm not even worth gloating over...you never saw me as a rival, then, did you?

[MSG$00E1E8,13]
I see now..."

[MSG$00E20F,29]
Nonogusa "I never said that!"

[MSG$00E246,35]
Nonogusa protests, almost in tears.

[MSG$00E276,45]
Kobayashi "You really piss me off, you know!"

[MSG$00E2BD,91]
Kobayashi "You didn't even join the team until sophomore year. You're so full of yourself!"

[MSG$00E332,59]
Kobayashi "I should be in that meet! But because of you..."

[MSG$00E387,75]
As Kobayashi shouts these words, she starts kicking Nonogusa over and over.

[MSG$00E3DF,38]
Nonogusa "Ouch...that hurts! Stop it!"

[MSG$00E41F,66]
Kobayashi "Just quit the team, why don't you? You little eyesore!"

[MSG$00E47B,30]
Nonogusa "That's too cruel..."

[MSG$00E4B3,79]
Kobayashi "You just make things harder for the rest of us. Don't you get that?"

[MSG$00E51C,67]
Nonogusa "What are you talking about? I'm just doing my best to..."

[MSG$00E579,57]
Kobayashi "That's what's such a pain in the butt for us!"

[MSG$00E5CC,42]
Kobayashi "So anyway...You'd better quit."

[MSG$00E610,15]
Nonogusa "..!?"

[MSG$00E62C,27]
Kobayashi "Quit, got that?"

[MSG$00E661,36]
Nonogusa "But no...I can't do that."

[MSG$00E69F,43]
Nonogusa "I have no intention of quitting."

[MSG$00E6E4,52]
Nonogusa tells Kobayashi this in no uncertain terms.

[MSG$00E725,15]
Kobayashi "..."

[MSG$00E741,38]
Kobayashi "Is that right? Fine, then."

[MSG$00E781,77]
Kobayashi "In that case, I'll make you quit if it takes everything I've got!"

[MSG$00E7E8,28]
Kobayashi "Mikimoto, ready?"

[MSG$00E81E,73]
The crony named Mikimoto nods her head and quickly steps behind Nonogusa.

[MSG$00E874,33]
Nonogusa "What...what are doing?"

[MSG$00E8AF,55]
Mikimoto grabs the flailing Nonogusa and pins her down.

[MSG$00E8F3,72]
Then she takes a roll of masking tape and binds Nonogusa, hand and foot.

[MSG$00E940,84]
Nonogusa frantically tries to escape, but she has no chance against the two of them.

[MSG$00EA43,59]
Nonogusa "You're so cruel! What are you going to do to me?"

[MSG$00EA98,65]
In no time, Nonogusa is immobile, and they push her to the floor.

[MSG$00EAE6,73]
Kobayashi "I'm warning you...if you fight back it's going to be painful."

[MSG$00EB49,75]
So saying, Kobayashi takes something out of the bag her friend was holding.

[MSG$00EBA1,16]
Nonogusa "Augh!"

[MSG$00EBCB,62]
Seeing what Kobayashi has in her hand, Nonogusa yelps in fear.

[MSG$00EC16,37]
Kobayashi is holding a huge vibrator.

[MSG$00ECC1,32]
Nonogusa "NO! Somebody, please!"

[MSG$00ECFB,51]
The instant she sees it, Nonogusa starts screaming.

[MSG$00ED3B,25]
Kobayashi "Shut up, you!"

[MSG$00ED6E,16]
Nonogusa ｛gulps｝

[MSG$00EE21,64]
Kobayashi removes her socks and stuffs them in Nonogusa's mouth.

[MSG$00EE6E,32]
Kobayashi "Eat my socks, bitch."

[MSG$00EEA8,67]
Kobayashi "You're going to get a feast down there, too...Ha ha ha!"

[MSG$00EF05,29]
Nonogusa "(Trying to scream)"

[MSG$00EFC5,16]
(Gripping sound)

[MSG$00EFE2,77]
Mikimoto grabs her by the chest, and peels the swimsuit down to her cleavage.

[MSG$00F034,86]
In that instant, her shapely bust spills out, freed from the confines of the swimsuit.

[MSG$00F097,16]
Nonogusa "Mmmm!"

[MSG$00F0C1,62]
Kobayashi "What lovely nipples. I could practically eat them!"

[MSG$00F119,79]
So saying, Kobayashi grabs both of Nonogusa's nipples and starts twisting them.

[MSG$00F175,71]
Kobayashi "Hey, Mikimoto, why don't you loosen her up down there, too?"

[MSG$00F1D6,30]
Mikimoto "All right, Captain."

[MSG$00F20E,55]
Mikimoto starts rubbing Nonogusa hard between her legs.

[MSG$00F252,22]
Nonogusa "Ohhh! Augh!"

[MSG$00F282,44]
Nonogusa begins to writhe from the friction.

[MSG$00F2BB,76]
Kobayashi "Her nipples are starting to stand up. How's it going down there?"

[MSG$00F321,68]
Mikimoto "I'm starting to get a reaction in this area too, Captain."

[MSG$00F37F,53]
Kobayashi "Oh? Then why don't you start peeling her?"

[MSG$00F3CE,97]
Hearing this, Mikimoto grabs the cloth covering Nonogusa's groin and pushes it to the side, hard.

[MSG$00F4C5,16]
Nonogusa "AUGH!"

[MSG$00F4EF,40]
This exposes Nonogusa's puff of a vulva.

[MSG$00F51C,66]
In the center I can see her pinkish, as-of-yet-unviolated crevice.

[MSG$00F56B,75]
Kobayashi "Yours hasn't seen much use yet. Don't you masturbate regularly?"

[MSG$00F5D0,18]
Nonogusa "Augh..."

[MSG$00F5FC,71]
Kobayashi starts feeling up Nonogusa between the legs with her fingers.

[MSG$00F650,66]
Kobayashi "You're not really getting wet...Mikimoto? Baby lotion."

[MSG$00F6AC,96]
Mikimoto does as she's told, fetching some baby lotion from her bag and handing it to Kobayashi.

[MSG$00F719,47]
Kobayashi "This is some extra service for you."

[MSG$00F762,85]
Kobayashi starts smearing the baby lotion over the vibrator, heaping it on thoroughly

[MSG$00F7BC,22]
|with a vulgar motion.

[MSG$00F7DF,31]
Kobayashi "Okay, here we go..."

[MSG$00F818,18]
Nonogusa "Augh..."

[MSG$00F844,90]
With a nasty little smile, Kobayashi grips the vibrator and brings it closer and closer to

[MSG$00F8A3,18]
|Nonogusa's vulva.

[MSG$00F95B,55]
You'd never get to see such a sight in a million years.

[MSG$00F997,55]
I feel guilty, but even so I can't take my eyes off it.

[MSG$00F9DB,75]
In this situation, I can't butt in or else things will get too complicated.

[MSG$00FA2B,16]
Sorry, Nonogusa.

[MSG$00FACC,76]
That's going too far. I've got to stop them or Nonogusa will have to suffer.

[MSG$00FB1D,25]
I've got to rescue her...

[MSG$00FB43,19]
But the thing is...

[MSG$00FB63,16]
My own crotch...

[MSG$00FB80,46]
Since I've been watching the series of events,

[MSG$00FBB3,66]
I've gotten an erection...it's clearly visible through my clothes.

[MSG$00FC02,55]
Hold on, stay clear-headed...If I jump out like this...

[MSG$00FDD0,6]
Thump!

[MSG$00FDE3,43]
Minase "Hahaha! Stop right there, you two!"

[MSG$00FE28,72]
Minase "No one but me can lay a hand on that girl. Don't you know that?"

[MSG$00FE8A,70]
Kobayashi "What are you talking about? What kind of nonsense is that?"

[MSG$00FEEA,70]
Kobayashi "Anyway, who do you think you are and where'd you come from?

[MSG$00FF35,35]
Don't tell me you've been peeping!"

[MSG$00FF72,16]
Minase "Gulp..."

[MSG$00FF9C,61]
Mikimoto "Hey, you're right, look at his thing! What a jerk."

[MSG$00FFF3,62]
Minase "Gulp...I'm going to let you off easy today. Farewell!"

[MSG$0100C4,33]
.................................

[MSG$0100F2,32]
I can just see that happening...

[MSG$01011F,16]
Sorry, Nonogusa.

[MSG$010134,107]
I'd like nothing better than to save you, but it would be like suicide for me to show myself in this state.

[MSG$0101A4,95]
I give up on the idea, having no choice, and instead start watching the proceedings in silence.

[MSG$010377,14]
The door opens

[MSG$010392,24]
Minase "Hey, stop it..."

[MSG$0103C4,16]
Kobayashi "Hey!"

[MSG$0103EE,88]
Kobayashi "We're in the middle of something here! Don't just come barging in like that!"

[MSG$010460,74]
Minase "Huh? No, you're wrong, it's a mistake! You're the ones who are..."

[MSG$0104C4,63]
Kobayashi "Augh! He's a voyeur! He came to spy on us changing!"

[MSG$01051D,60]
Mikimoto "Ugh, he's got an erection! We're gonna get raped!"

[MSG$010573,37]
Minase "What? Why is this happening?"

[MSG$01062B,33]
.................................

[MSG$010659,32]
I can just see that happening...

[MSG$010686,16]
Sorry, Nonogusa.

[MSG$01069B,107]
I'd like nothing better than to save you, but it would be like suicide for me to show myself in this state.

[MSG$01070B,95]
I give up on the idea, having no choice, and instead start watching the proceedings in silence.

[MSG$0107F4,24]
Nonogusa "Augh...aaaah!"

[MSG$010826,55]
Nonogusa starts frantically writhing, trying to escape.

[MSG$01086A,55]
Kobayashi "It's no use, no one's coming. Just give in."

[MSG$010934,90]
The vibrator inches ever closer to her vulva, until at last the tip is pressed against it.

[MSG$01099B,18]
Nonogusa "(yelps)"

[MSG$0109C7,103]
Nonogusa tries to resist entry of this foreign object by putting all her strength in her lower stomach.

[MSG$010A3B,26]
Kobayashi "Are you ready?"

[MSG$010A6F,24]
Kobayashi "Here I go..."

[MSG$010AA1,53]
At the same time she exerts pressure on the vibrator.

[MSG$010AE3,65]
The huge, glistening tip of the vibrator forces her crevice open.

[MSG$010B31,18]
Nonogusa "Ugh...."

[MSG$010B5D,92]
Kobayashi "Now, now...you've got to do better than that or it's going to go all the way in."

[MSG$010BD3,19]
Slither, slither...

[MSG$010BF3,52]
Kobayashi "Hahaha...It's going in, it's going in..."

[MSG$010C41,19]
Slither, slither...

[MSG$010CDA,22]
Nonogusa "Mmmm! Urgh!"

[MSG$010D0A,52]
Kobayashi "Oh, my. I think it just tore your hymen."

[MSG$010D58,70]
Kobayashi "So you were a virgin. Was it wrong of me to do this, then?"

[MSG$010DB8,88]
Blood starts trickling from the vibrator, which is jammed deep inside Nonogusa's vagina.

[MSG$010E1D,95]
Kobayashi "But still, it's not everyone who gets an electric orgasm for their very first time!"

[MSG$010E96,32]
Kobayashi "Lucky you! Hahahaha!"

[MSG$010ED0,23]
Nonogusa "Ugh...ugh..."

[MSG$010F01,40]
Kobayashi "Mikimoto, let's get a photo."

[MSG$010F43,24]
Mikimoto "Yes, Captain."

[MSG$010F75,44]
Mikimoto has a Polaroid camera in her hands,

[MSG$010FA6,53]
and snaps a picture of Nonogusa in this vulgar state.

[MSG$01105B,5]
Snap!

[MSG$0110E0,5]
Snap!

[MSG$0110F2,92]
Mikimoto snaps photo after photo, and hands the results spit out by the camera to Kobayashi.

[MSG$01115B,53]
Kobayashi takes each picture, waving each in the air,

[MSG$011195,68]
and gazes at the emerging images of Nonogusa in her vulgar position.

[MSG$0111E6,54]
Kobayashi "I don't know, there's something missing..."

[MSG$011236,68]
Kobayashi "Mikimoto, why don't you stick something up her ass, too?"

[MSG$011294,24]
Mikimoto "Yes, Captain."

[MSG$0112C6,97]
Mikimoto starts rooting around in her bag, and pulls out a travel-size bottle of deodorant spray.

[MSG$011334,26]
Mikimoto "How about this?"

[MSG$011368,51]
Kobayashi "It's just the right size and thickness."

[MSG$0113B5,31]
Kobayashi "Go on, stick it in."

[MSG$011477,118]
Just as she did before, Mikimoto smears baby lotion all over the spray bottle, and presses it against Nonogusa's anus.

[MSG$0114FA,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$011515,84]
Nonogusa is still in shock from what just happened, and lies there limply in a daze.

[MSG$011576,48]
Mikimoto "If you strain yourself, it will hurt."

[MSG$0115C0,65]
Without hesitation, she shoves it straight up Nonogusa's asshole.

[MSG$011687,19]
Nonogusa "Aaaaaah!"

[MSG$0116B4,81]
As soon as her ass is pierced, Nonogusa spasms as if she's had an electric shock.

[MSG$011712,20]
Nonogusa "Mmm! Ugh!"

[MSG$011740,67]
Nonogusa wriggles desperately, trying to dislodge it from her anus.

[MSG$011788,59]
And the object protruding from her ass jiggles accordingly.

[MSG$0117D0,42]
Kobayashi "Hahaha! Such a pathetic sight!"

[MSG$011814,65]
Kobayashi "I'm sure you'd hate to have anyone see you like this."

[MSG$01186F,59]
Nonogusa doesn't seem to be able to hear what she's saying;

[MSG$0118AF,89]
she's staring at the two objects protruding from both sides of her lower body, in a daze.

[MSG$011915,61]
Mikimoto "Disgusting. Why don't you take a look at yourself?"

[MSG$01196C,77]
Nonogusa silently listens to their words of ridicule, tears filling her eyes.

[MSG$0119C6,80]
Kobayashi "Well, we've got some great pictures. You can have one as a keepsake."

[MSG$011AB9,93]
Looking over each of the photos, Kobayashi selects one and lays it on top of Nonogusa's body.

[MSG$011B23,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$011B3E,107]
Kobayashi "If you don't want these photos circulating all over the place, get your butt off our swim team!"

[MSG$011BC3,31]
Kobayashi "Let's go, Mikimoto."

[MSG$011BFC,54]
The two girls loosen the tape that's binding Nonogusa.

[MSG$011C37,59]
They then start to leave the room, leaving Nonogusa behind.

[MSG$011C9A,44]
I dash into the classroom next door to hide.

[MSG$011D50,14]
The door opens

[MSG$011D6B,53]
Mikimoto "You don't think she'll tell on us, do you?"

[MSG$011DBA,89]
Kobayashi "Don't worry. As long as we've got these photos, she won't do anything stupid."

[MSG$011E2D,92]
Kobayashi "Anyway, I want to treat you to something for helping me out. Let's go to a cafe."

[MSG$011EA3,31]
Mikimoto "What about practice?"

[MSG$011EDC,74]
Kobayashi "Oh, it won't matter if we're a little late. Come on, let's go."

[MSG$011F40,78]
Still talking, the two girls walk slowly past the classroom where I've hidden.

[MSG$011F93,54]
I make sure they're gone, then step out into the hall.

[MSG$011FDC,52]
I shut the door tight in a rush, and hold my breath.

[MSG$01209A,14]
The door opens

[MSG$0120B5,53]
Mikimoto "You don't think she'll tell on us, do you?"

[MSG$012104,89]
Kobayashi "Don't worry. As long as we've got these photos, she won't do anything stupid."

[MSG$012177,92]
Kobayashi "Anyway, I want to treat you to something for helping me out. Let's go to a cafe."

[MSG$0121ED,31]
Mikimoto "What about practice?"

[MSG$012226,74]
Kobayashi "Oh, it won't matter if we're a little late. Come on, let's go."

[MSG$01228A,59]
Still talking, the two girls walk slowly past the classroom

[MSG$0122CA,18]
where I've hidden.

[MSG$0122E9,57]
Now there's no one in the room but Nonogusa and myself...

[MSG$012331,52]
I ended up watching the whole thing until the end...

[MSG$012372,117]
Those damned girls...how could they gang up on Nonogusa and treat her so cruelly? Now that's what you'd call a crime.

[MSG$0123F4,93]
Although I'm in no position to judge them, since I just stood there and watched them do it...

[MSG$012473,32]
All right, what should I do now?

[MSG$012498,34]
Should I help Nonogusa, or else...

[MSG$0124F0,24]
April 22 - Help Nonogusa

[MSG$012531,52]
I can't just let them get away with this, I guess...

[MSG$012572,82]
I should try to get those pictures from them somehow, and give them to Nonogusa...

[MSG$0125C9,63]
Luckily, I now have the skills to pull off something like that.

[MSG$012630,59]
As soon as I make my decision, I hurry after the two girls.

[MSG$01267E,55]
As soon as I make my decision, I slip out of the locker

[MSG$0126BA,65]
|making sure Nonogusa doesn't notice me, and leave the classroom.

[MSG$012708,65]
Nonogusa is in out of it, so she doesn't seem to notice that I've

[MSG$01274E,39]
|stepped out of the locker by the door.

[MSG$012782,64]
I make sure she doesn't, then I hurry after the other two girls.

[MSG$0127CF,93]
Kobayashi and Mikimoto enter the swim team's changing room/clubhouse. They emerge soon after.

[MSG$012831,73]
I watch them leave the school grounds, then sneak into the changing room.

[MSG$012903,8]
Click...

[MSG$012918,24]
Minase "Is anyone here?"

[MSG$01294A,93]
I whisper these words to make sure no one's inside, then I go in and lock the door behind me.

[MSG$0129AC,72]
At the same time, I lock the door on the other side leading to the pool.

[MSG$0129F9,23]
Now no one can come in.

[MSG$012A1D,21]
Then I start working.

[MSG$012A3F,60]
Those two didn't take their bags with them when they left...

[MSG$012B04,43]
I search for their lockers and look inside.

[MSG$012B34,83]
Their lockers aren't locked. Actually, the locks on most of the lockers are broken.

[MSG$012B94,42]
I take out their bags and start searching.

[MSG$012BCB,36]
I find what I'm looking for at once.

[MSG$012BFC,78]
A Polaroid camera and photos. The photos show Nonogusa in a most vulgar light.

[MSG$012C4F,29]
I put them away in my pocket.

[MSG$012C79,43]
There's still some film left in the camera.

[MSG$012CA9,88]
I think I'll use this camera to take photos of those girls in a compromising position...

[MSG$012D0E,76]
In order to set my plan in motion, I remove their swimsuits from their bags.

[MSG$012D67,56]
I take a magic marker from my pocket and remove the cap.

[MSG$012DAC,62]
Minase "Let's see...I think I wrote down the charm somewhere."

[MSG$012E04,72]
I take my notes from my inner pocket, and find the appropriate talisman.

[MSG$012E59,93]
Then I turn their swimsuits inside-out, and copy the charm onto the area over their crotches.

[MSG$012EC3,20]
Scratch...scratch...

[MSG$012EE4,77]
Inside each circle I draw a triangle formed from lines and the names of gods.

[MSG$012F36,55]
Around the circle, I write a passage from Genesis 1:28,

[MSG$012F72,116]
|''And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it''

[MSG$012FEB,10]
|in Latin.

[MSG$01307E,112]
When I'm done drawing the charms on both of their swimsuits, I put them back in their bags inside their lockers.

[MSG$0130F3,23]
I just hope it works...

[MSG$013117,54]
I borrow the camera, and hide in the storage closet...

[MSG$0131D7,56]
Now all I have to do is wait for those two to come back.

[MSG$01321C,50]
I was a little worried that they might not return,

[MSG$013253,78]
but the fact that they'd left their bags was proof that they were coming back.

[MSG$0132A6,80]
Besides, I'd heard them say they were going to practice, even if they were late.

[MSG$013303,19]
I wait patiently...

[MSG$013323,17]
15 minutes go by.

[MSG$013339,30]
Suddenly I hear the door open.

[MSG$013364,8]
Click...

[MSG$013379,79]
Kobayashi "(Giggles) All right, we're going to switch gears and swim hard now."

[MSG$0133E2,82]
Mikimoto "Right. You've the top spot to represent our school is as good as yours."

[MSG$01344E,60]
Mikimoto "I know that little bitch will quit the swim team."

[MSG$0134A4,100]
Kobayashi "That's her punishment for humiliating me. Now this is just between you and me, got that?"

[MSG$013522,26]
Mikimoto "Yes, of course."

[MSG$013556,71]
Still talking, the two girls head for their lockers and start changing.

[MSG$0135AA,40]
I can hear the rustle of their clothing.

[MSG$0135DF,63]
After a while, the sounds stop, as if they'd finished changing.

[MSG$013623,40]
Then I hear their lockers slamming shut.

[MSG$013658,30]
Quietly I take a peek at them.

[MSG$013769,41]
Kobayashi "Hey, aren't you a little hot?"

[MSG$0137AC,37]
Mikimoto "Now that you mention it..."

[MSG$0137EB,49]
Kobayashi "Ugh...my swimsuit's sticking to me..."

[MSG$013836,22]
Mikimoto "Uhhh... Oh!"

[MSG$013866,30]
Mikimoto "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01389E,31]
Kobayashi "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$0138D7,43]
I can clearly hear their labored breathing.

[MSG$013907,52]
Sounds like everything's going according to my plan.

[MSG$013948,44]
Kobayashi "Hey...I feel a little strange..."

[MSG$01398E,25]
Mikimoto "Me...me too..."

[MSG$0139C1,23]
Kobayashi "Mikimoto..."

[MSG$0139F2,69]
Mikimoto "Stop it, please, Captain! If somebody sees us like this..."

[MSG$013A51,106]
Kobayashi "Don't worry, I locked the door. Besides, no one will be coming back from practice for a while."

[MSG$013AD5,17]
Mikimoto "But..."

[MSG$013B00,99]
Kobayashi "Come on, now, take it off. I'm taking off mine too. This is an order from your captain."

[MSG$013B7D,80]
I could tell by the sound of it that they were trying to remove their swimsuits.

[MSG$013BD2,85]
In the midst of this suggestive conversation and the sounds of their heavy breathing,

[MSG$013C2C,47]
I gulp hard and peer out at what they're doing.

[MSG$013CE4,37]
Kobayashi "Lick...lick me, Mikimoto!"

[MSG$013D23,16]
Mikimoto "Mmmm!"

[MSG$013D4D,11]
Lick, slurp

[MSG$013D65,37]
Kobayashi "Ahhh! That feels so good!"

[MSG$013DA4,61]
I see Mikimoto pressing her mouth against Kobayashi's crotch.

[MSG$013DE6,87]
Kobayashi is enraptured by the sensation. She's trembling all over from the excitement.

[MSG$013E4A,88]
Kobayashi "Suck some more! Come on, use your tongue...that's right! You're doing great!"

[MSG$013EBC,22]
Mikimoto "Mmm...ahhh!"

[MSG$013EEC,114]
Kobayashi "Put your tongue inside. Lick away everything that comes out, will you? Oooh! That's it, you've got it!"

[MSG$013F78,22]
Slurp, slurp, slurp...

[MSG$013F9B,81]
Lewd sucking sounds and labored breathing alternate. It's like a depraved melody.

[MSG$013FF1,104]
The two girls are totally caught up in their own world, engrossed in what they're doing to each other...

[MSG$014066,119]
I can see that the talisman is working. Two girls...not only that, but in a place like this, without even hesitating...

[MSG$0140E2,77]
For them to engage in lewd conduct like this! Normally it would never happen.

[MSG$01413C,51]
Unless of course, these two had done this before...

[MSG$01417C,61]
Kobayashi "Well? How am I down there? Do you like the taste?"

[MSG$0141D3,85]
How the hell could it taste good? With that thought in mind, I go on staring at them.

[MSG$014235,89]
Mikimoto "Yes, it's good. With all that juice flowing out, your pussy is so delicious..."

[MSG$0142A8,60]
Kobayashi "You're so sweet...Hey, now let's both feel good!"

[MSG$0142FE,92]
With this suggestion, Kobayashi places Mikimoto under her, and covers her with her own body.

[MSG$0143EF,63]
Kobayashi "All right...let's rub ourselves against each other!"

[MSG$014448,56]
Mikimoto "All right. Please, Captain, do what you will."

[MSG$01449A,16]
Mikimoto "AHHH!"

[MSG$0144C4,67]
Kobayashi "(giggles) You're so toned down there...it feels so good.

[MSG$01450C,56]
You must really be aroused. Did it excite you that much,

[MSG$014549,22]
licking me like that?"

[MSG$014579,23]
Mikimoto "Yes. Oh! Ah!"

[MSG$0145AA,94]
Kobayashi and Mikimoto continue to rub up against each other and are in the throes of ecstasy.

[MSG$014615,100]
At the same time they're pressing their breasts against each other, and their nipples are entangled.

[MSG$014686,73]
Mikimoto's breasts are mushing under Kobayashi's weight. I watch silently

[MSG$0146D4,48]
|as those erect nipples are kneaded and twisted.

[MSG$014711,76]
Kobayashi "That's it! I want you to rub harder against me with your hips..."

[MSG$014777,58]
Mikimoto "It feels so good, Captain! I can come any time!"

[MSG$0147CB,85]
Kobayashi "Hold it in a little longer...Let's make ourselves feel even better first!"

[MSG$01483A,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$014862,58]
So saying, Kobayashi starts grinding her hips even harder.

[MSG$0148A9,17]
Mikimoto "Ahhhh!"

[MSG$0148D4,52]
The juice comes gushing out from between their legs.

[MSG$01490D,93]
It's running together, giving off a squishing sound each time they rub up against each other.

[MSG$01496F,64]
The juice streams down Mikimoto's ass, and drips onto the floor.

[MSG$0149DF,46]
Damn...it's making me as horny as all get-out!

[MSG$014A1A,51]
Watching the two girls is definitely turning me on.

[MSG$014A52,74]
Who could blame me? After all, they'd just put on that other sensuous show

[MSG$014AA1,51]
|right before my eyes. How could I not get aroused?

[MSG$014AE1,82]
But then I remembered I had a job to do, and clutched the Polaroid camera tightly.

[MSG$014B40,88]
The reason I'm here is to get a picture of what's going on right now, and save Nonogusa.

[MSG$014B9D,96]
That's what I tell myself as I try to calm my throbbing groin. Slowly I exit the storage locker.

[MSG$014C10,46]
Damn...it's making me as horny as all get-out!

[MSG$014C4B,112]
I'd just come a few minutes ago, and here I was, getting another boner from watching these two have intercourse.

[MSG$014CC0,96]
The sight of two girls entwined in such an erotic way...it was new for me, and so provocative...

[MSG$014D2D,82]
But then I remembered I had a job to do, and clutched the Polaroid camera tightly.

[MSG$014D8C,88]
The reason I'm here is to get a picture of what's going on right now, and save Nonogusa.

[MSG$014DE9,57]
The point will be lost if I don't get the damned picture.

[MSG$014E2F,96]
That's what I tell myself as I try to calm my throbbing groin. Slowly I exit the storage locker.

[MSG$014E9C,92]
Luckily for me, the two girls are so lost in their ecstasy that they don't even notice me...

[MSG$014F05,16]
Now's my chance!

[MSG$014F1A,61]
I approach the girls, my camera trained on them as I advance.

[MSG$014F64,41]
Kobayashi "That's right, keep that up..."

[MSG$014FA7,45]
Mikimoto "Ahhh...mmm...this is unbelievable!"

[MSG$014FEE,53]
I frame them in my viewfinder, and press the shutter.

[MSG$015122,5]
Snap!

[MSG$015134,16]
Mikimoto "Huh?!"

[MSG$01515E,33]
Kobayashi "Who the hell's there?"

[MSG$015199,70]
I pull out the photo that's just been spit out, and take another shot.

[MSG$01525F,35]
Minase "Hey, don't mind me. Go on!"

[MSG$01529C,54]
Mikimoto "I don't believe it! You're taking pictures?"

[MSG$0152EC,79]
Kobayashi "How'd you get in here? And what the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$015355,72]
Still lying vulva-to-vulva and grinding away, the two girls snarl at me.

[MSG$01541D,39]
Minase "Now, now, calm down, will you?"

[MSG$01545E,120]
Mikimoto "Captain! Please, stop doing that with your hips. Or else he's going to get another picture of us like this..."

[MSG$0154F0,95]
Mikimoto's words bring Kobayashi to her senses, and she tries to move away from the other girl.

[MSG$01555C,52]
Kobayashi "What's going on? I can't stop thrusting!"

[MSG$0155AA,24]
Mikimoto "No way! AHHH!"

[MSG$0155DC,102]
Contrary to Kobayashi's will, her body continues to grind relentlessly, in pursuit of further ecstasy.

[MSG$0156CA,41]
Minase "That's good...just keep that up."

[MSG$01570D,71]
I egg them on and keep taking pictures until there's no more film left.

[MSG$0157D4,14]
Snap...snap...

[MSG$0157EF,96]
Minase "Whew...I got a lot of great pictures. You sure look like a couple of idiots in these..."

[MSG$01592F,35]
Kobayashi "Give...give them to me!"

[MSG$01596C,16]
Minase "No way."

[MSG$015996,83]
Kobayashi "What do you want? If it's money you're after, I'll give you a little..."

[MSG$015A03,33]
Minase "I don't want your money."

[MSG$015A3E,42]
Kobayashi "Then what do you want from us?"

[MSG$015AAB,28]
April 22 - Divine Punishment

[MSG$015ACA,76]
Minase "You just did something just like this to somebody else, didn't you?"

[MSG$015B30,55]
I direct my words towards Kobayashi as coldly as I can.

[MSG$015B74,78]
Kobayashi "What the...? Don't tell me that little bitch put you up to this..."

[MSG$015BDC,74]
Kobayashi "You wouldn't happen to be responsible for all this, would you?"

[MSG$015C40,31]
Minase "Good question...anyway,

[MSG$015C64,54]
if you guys don't want these pictures all over school,

[MSG$015C9F,26]
you'd better do as I say."

[MSG$015CD3,38]
Kobayashi "Hold on! Give those to me!"

[MSG$015D13,48]
Mikimoto "Oh, come on...please, hand them over!"

[MSG$015D6B,79]
At that moment, it occurs to me that I might as well make them suffer a little.

[MSG$015DBF,45]
After all, they deserved a little punishment.

[MSG$015DF9,61]
Minase "Okay, then, I'll think about it if you satisfy me..."

[MSG$015E50,55]
Kobayashi "All...all right. We'll do anything you ask."

[MSG$015F1E,58]
I drop my pants and shove my suddenly erect penis at them.

[MSG$015F65,82]
My balls were ready to explode, after having been exposed to two lurid sex scenes.

[MSG$015FBC,57]
Damn right they should be the ones to remedy the problem.

[MSG$016002,74]
Kobayashi and Mikimoto, still caught up in the passion they'd just shared,

[MSG$016051,56]
force themselves to get up and shuffle towards my penis.

[MSG$016096,54]
Mikimoto "Whoa...whoa! I can't believe how big it is!"

[MSG$0160E6,110]
Minase "See, it's all your fault for doing all that stuff in front of me. You'd better take care of me right."

[MSG$01616E,80]
Kobayashi "But you're really going to give us the pictures if we do you, right?"

[MSG$0161D8,14]
Minase "Sure."

[MSG$016200,80]
Hearing my words, both Kobayashi and Mikimoto assault my penis at the same time.

[MSG$0162D5,105]
They sit me down on a nearby bench, stick their breasts together and then sandwich my penis between them.

[MSG$01634B,59]
I'm caught between their cleavage. It arouses me even more.

[MSG$016393,78]
Their elasticity is foreign to me.  It makes chills shoot up and down my cock.

[MSG$0163E6,57]
It's my first time, and soon I'm trembling with pleasure.

[MSG$01642C,40]
Minase "Ahhh...hey, that's pretty good."

[MSG$01646E,25]
Slither, slither, slither

[MSG$016494,103]
Keeping in time with each other, the girls start rubbing up against my penis by swinging their breasts.

[MSG$016508,109]
Kobayashi, still swaying, lets a trickle of saliva run down her chin, after which it drops into her cleavage.

[MSG$01657A,55]
It begins to accumulate there, and spill onto my penis.

[MSG$0165BE,66]
It provides instant lubrication, and I soon I'm in blissful agony.

[MSG$01660D,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$016635,17]
Minase "Ohhhh..."

[MSG$016660,54]
I'm so aroused that I'm ready to ejaculate in a flash.

[MSG$01669B,55]
I guess I don't have time to wallow in this pleasure...

[MSG$0166DF,32]
Minase "Hey...I'm gonna come..."

[MSG$01671A,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$016742,88]
Hearing this, the two girls intensify their fondling, pushing harder with their breasts.

[MSG$0167A7,100]
Thanks to this, I soon reach unbearable heights of ecstasy, and my body begins to tremble violently.

[MSG$016810,29]
I won't last much longer now.

[MSG$01683A,35]
Minase "Damn...I'm gonna come now!"

[MSG$016877,63]
I hold it in as long as I can, and then let it all out at once.

[MSG$0168C3,14]
Minase "Ohhh!"

[MSG$016964,19]
Spurt! Gush! Splat!

[MSG$0169FD,18]
Kobayashi "Aaaah!"

[MSG$016A29,15]
Mikimoto "Hey!"

[MSG$016A52,115]
An unbelievable amount of white liquid is spurting from my penis, which is sticking out from between their breasts.

[MSG$016ACA,60]
And it comes raining down on Kobayashi and Mikimoto's faces.

[MSG$016B3B,17]
(Spurting noises)

[MSG$016BD2,89]
Probably because I'd held it in so long, it didn't stop for what seemed like an eternity.

[MSG$016C30,47]
I keep releasing gushes of semen over and over,

[MSG$016C64,74]
and it streams down the two girls' bodies and pools inside their cleavage.

[MSG$016CBB,28]
Minase "(Breathing heavily)"

[MSG$016CF1,80]
I'm out of breath as I stare at the two girls, who are now sticky with my semen.

[MSG$016D4E,66]
Kobayashi "We gave you relief, didn't we? Give us the photos now."

[MSG$016DAA,20]
Mikimoto "Please..."

[MSG$016DD8,79]
I pull my penis from between their breasts, pull up my pants and then stand up.

[MSG$016F0F,41]
Minase "I guess I have no choice...Here."

[MSG$016F52,89]
I choose the worst picture out of the batch I just took, and toss it at Kobayashi's feet.

[MSG$016FB8,63]
Kobayashi "What...what the hell? This isn't what we agreed on!"

[MSG$017011,63]
Minase "Who said anything about giving you all of the pictures?

[MSG$017055,77]
These are valuable, dammit. You should be grateful that I even gave you one."

[MSG$0170BC,35]
Kobayashi "You can't be serious..."

[MSG$0170F9,33]
Kobayashi is stunned by my words.

[MSG$017127,45]
Minase "You brought it on yourself...See ya!"

[MSG$01716E,22]
Kobayashi "No...wait!"

[MSG$01719E,58]
I leave them with those words and beat it out of the room.

[MSG$0171DD,49]
The girls are both naked and can't come after me.

[MSG$017299,12]
Door closing

[MSG$0172BA,70]
I've gotten relief from my pent-up libido, so I'm in a very good mood.

[MSG$017305,55]
Too bad for those girls, but this is divine punishment.

[MSG$017349,99]
I make sure the photos are in my pocket, and head back to the school building to look for Nonogusa.

[MSG$0173B9,17]
April 22 - Photos

[MSG$0174AF,104]
On my way back to the classroom where she'd been tortured, I spot Nonogusa. She's trudging down the hall

[MSG$017524,80]
With a totally blank look on her face, she's stumbling along like a sleepwalker.

[MSG$017581,49]
I stop in front of her, and block Nonogusa's way.

[MSG$0175BF,88]
Nonogusa tries to go in another direction to avoid me. I stop her by calling out to her.

[MSG$017656,18]
Minase "Nonogusa."

[MSG$017682,74]
Nonogusa flinches at the sound of my voice, then fearfully looks up at me.

[MSG$0176D9,35]
Nonogusa "What...what do you want?"

[MSG$017716,16]
Minase "Here..."

[MSG$017740,67]
I take the photos of Nonogusa from my pocket, and hand them to her.

[MSG$017790,13]
Nonogusa "?!"

[MSG$0177AA,27]
Nonogusa "But these are..."

[MSG$0177DF,32]
Nonogusa stares at me, confused.

[MSG$01780C,69]
Minase "You don't have to worry anymore. I got these back for you..."

[MSG$01786B,39]
Nonogusa "You did that for me? Minase?"

[MSG$0178AC,44]
Minase "I couldn't let them do that to you."

[MSG$017924,31]
Nonogusa "Thank...thank you..."

[MSG$01795D,106]
Nonogusa's eyes fill with tears as she repeatedly expresses her gratitude to me; she asks me no questions.

[MSG$0179D4,55]
Minase "I warned those two not to come near you again."

[MSG$017A25,51]
Nonogusa "I don't know how I can ever thank you..."

[MSG$017A72,46]
Minase "Don't worry about it. It's all right."

[MSG$017ABA,34]
Minase "Well, I'm going home now."

[MSG$017AF6,38]
Nonogusa "Okay...thank you so much..."

[MSG$017B5A,91]
I make my best effort to be cool, and make a leisurely exit as the Knight in Shining Armor.

[MSG$017BBA,40]
I'm so cool I almost blow myself away...

[MSG$017BEF,40]
Nonogusa stares at me as I swagger away.

[MSG$017C24,32]
I give myself a pat on the back.

[MSG$017C49,66]
I think that was a productive use of magic, if I do say so myself.

[MSG$017C98,95]
I guess this means that depending on how you use it, black magic can actually help others, too.

[MSG$017CFC,99]
As it turned out, I mistreated those two girls, but they did bring it onto themselves, didn't they?

[MSG$017D6C,88]
I make sure I don't get spotted by Imari as I rush off the school grounds and head home.

[MSG$017DD7,19]
April 22 - The Deal

[MSG$017DFA,10]
Hang on...

[MSG$017E09,96]
If you really think about it, I've got Nonogusa's ultimate vulnerability in the palm of my hand.

[MSG$017E76,76]
If I use it to my advantage, I might get something really amazing out of it.

[MSG$017EC7,64]
If I appear in front of Nonogusa right now, she won't refuse me.

[MSG$017F14,33]
I can always save her afterwards.

[MSG$017F3A,85]
All I could think about right now was having her give me relief from my pent-up lust.

[MSG$017F9C,97]
Besides, it would be better for me to get something out of it too, rather than save her for free.

[MSG$01800A,111]
It's pretty low, taking advantage of her when she's vulnerable, but I convince myself that it's my just reward.

[MSG$01807E,83]
After all, I'm going to rescue her, so why shouldn't I enjoy myself a little first?

[MSG$0180DE,97]
I open the door quietly, and slowly approach Nonogusa where she lies in the deserted classroom...

[MSG$0181EE,17]
Nonogusa "Ugh..."

[MSG$018219,71]
Nonogusa is still crumpled on the floor where the other girls left her.

[MSG$018265,54]
She spits out the saliva-drenched sock from her mouth,

[MSG$0182A0,73]
and rips away the tape binding her arms and legs. Crying all the while...

[MSG$0182F6,68]
Nonogusa "Ugh...ohhh...how could they...how could they be so cruel?"

[MSG$018354,63]
Sobbing, Nonogusa tries to extract the vibrator from her vulva.

[MSG$018429,14]
Nonogusa "Oh!"

[MSG$018451,14]
It slides out.

[MSG$018464,60]
There's blood and other bodily fluids all over the vibrator.

[MSG$0184AD,31]
Nonogusa "Now for this side..."

[MSG$01856F,54]
So saying, she pulls out the object stuck in her anus.

[MSG$0185AA,95]
The can of deodorant has been shoved deeply up her ass. But she finally manages to pull it out.

[MSG$018616,27]
Nonogusa "Oh, please! Ugh!"

[MSG$01864B,59]
She throws the can that had been up her ass onto the floor.

[MSG$018693,15]
Clang, clang...

[MSG$0186AF,30]
Nonogusa "Ugh...ohhh...ugh..."

[MSG$0186E7,68]
This is when she finally notices I'm there, and turns to look at me.

[MSG$0187B1,23]
Nonogusa "Who's there?"

[MSG$0187E2,14]
Our eyes meet.

[MSG$0187F5,55]
As soon as she sees me, the blood drains from her face.

[MSG$018839,18]
Nonogusa "Minase!"

[MSG$018865,31]
She says this when she sees me.

[MSG$018891,43]
Nonogusa "Don't tell me you were watching?"

[MSG$0188D6,15]
Minase "I was."

[MSG$0188FF,27]
I speak quietly and calmly.

[MSG$0189A0,16]
Nonogusa "Oh..."

[MSG$0189CA,50]
Hearing this, she lets her head drop and whispers.

[MSG$018A09,92]
Nonogusa "I see...so I had an audience...Ha, ha, ha! This is really funny, huh? Ha, ha, ha!"

[MSG$018A7F,57]
She says these words sadly, tears dripping down her face.

[MSG$018AC5,88]
Nonogusa "If I'd known this was going to happen, I never would've joined the swim team!"

[MSG$018B37,64]
Nonogusa "After all my hard work...and just look what happened."

[MSG$018B91,17]
Nonogusa "(sobs)"

[MSG$018BBC,94]
Nonogusa begins to sob again, desperately trying to wipe away the tears pouring from her eyes.

[MSG$018C27,29]
Minase "Want me to help you?"

[MSG$018C5E,48]
I play devil's advocate to the sobbing Nonogusa.

[MSG$018C9B,27]
Nonogusa "But you can't..."

[MSG$018CD0,110]
Nonogusa "Now that they have those horrible photos of me, there's nothing we can do. Who knows what they'll do

[MSG$018D43,41]
|with them if I make any kind of move..."

[MSG$018D86,63]
Minase "But don't you want to make them pay for what they did?"

[MSG$018DDF,93]
Nonogusa "Of course I do! Look what they did to me! Nobody in their right mind would just let

[MSG$018E41,27]
|something like this go..."

[MSG$018E76,103]
Nonogusa "There's no way that I can make them pay. Kobayashi's got the whole swim team under her thumb.

[MSG$018EE2,71]
If I tried to get revenge, who knows what they'd do to me next time..."

[MSG$018F43,18]
Inwardly, I smirk.

[MSG$018F62,37]
Minase "I'll help you if you want..."

[MSG$018FA1,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$018FBC,77]
Minase "If you want me to, I'll make those two pay for what they did to you!"

[MSG$019023,38]
Nonogusa "But can you really do that?"

[MSG$019063,29]
Minase "Yeah, I promise you."

[MSG$01909A,25]
Minase "And in return..."

[MSG$0190CD,40]
I let my gaze wash over Nonogusa's body.

[MSG$0190FA,98]
After witnessing that scene just now, I've gotten to the point where I can barely control my lust.

[MSG$019169,69]
This is just a transaction. I'll grant her wish if she grants mine...

[MSG$0191BB,83]
Nonogusa "All right...I'm not going to really care anymore, whatever you do to me."

[MSG$019228,81]
Nonogusa "If I can get back at those two, I'll even sell my soul to the devil..."

[MSG$019293,79]
Nonogusa knows exactly what I have in mind, and willingly offers herself to me.

[MSG$0192EF,59]
Nonogusa "Go ahead, you can have your way with me, Minase."

[MSG$019344,63]
Nonogusa "Make me forget the horrible things they did to me..."

[MSG$019418,65]
When I hear her say this, I shove her to the floor in a delirium.

[MSG$019466,59]
I get on top of her and tug her swim suit down to her legs.

[MSG$01952E,16]
Nonogusa "Ahhh!"

[MSG$019558,60]
Massaging Nonogusa's exposed breasts, I suck on her nipples.

[MSG$019599,54]
I'm enjoying the sensation of her nipples in my mouth.

[MSG$0195DC,34]
Nonogusa "This is embarrassing..."

[MSG$019618,72]
Nonogusa whispers this as she turns red, watching me suckle her breasts.

[MSG$01966D,94]
I run my tongue over her nipples, then start fondling her between the legs with my other hand.

[MSG$0196D8,16]
Nonogusa "Ahhh!"

[MSG$019702,56]
With my fingers, I trace along the crevice in her vulva.

[MSG$01973F,50]
My fingers grasp the protuberance and I fondle it.

[MSG$01977E,43]
Nonogusa "That...that feels really good..."

[MSG$0197C3,32]
I can't hold it in any longer...

[MSG$0197F0,71]
Minase "Is it okay if I put it in you now? I can't hold it in anymore."

[MSG$019851,58]
Nonogusa "Wait...First I want to see yours too, Minase..."

[MSG$0198A5,34]
She blushes as she whispers to me.

[MSG$0198D4,83]
Nonogusa "You saw mine, didn't you? That's why I want you to show me yours, too..."

[MSG$019941,52]
Nonogusa "Because I've never seen a guy's before..."

[MSG$01998F,19]
Minase "All right."

[MSG$019A45,83]
I do my best to restrain myself, and take off my shirt and pants. I stand over her.

[MSG$019AA5,44]
Then I pull my swollen penis from my shorts.

[MSG$019AD6,73]
It was bigger and more erect than usual. I could ejaculate at any moment.

[MSG$019B2C,92]
Revealed before Nonogusa's eyes, the pinkish tip is swollen tight and throbbing in time with

[MSG$019B8D,10]
|my pulse.

[MSG$019BA4,26]
Nonogusa "Can I touch it?"

[MSG$019BD8,68]
Nonogusa asks me timidly, staring right at my huge, throbbing prick.

[MSG$019C29,10]
I nod yes.

[MSG$019C40,63]
Nonogusa brings her slender hand closer and closer to my penis.

[MSG$019D05,17]
Nonogusa "Ahh..."

[MSG$019D30,70]
She touches my hot, fired-up penis, then closes her fingers around it.

[MSG$019D83,22]
Nonogusa "It's hot..."

[MSG$019DB3,43]
After taking in the sensation for a moment,

[MSG$019DE3,80]
she suddenly starts moving her hand up and down, as if the idea just struck her.

[MSG$019EB9,16]
Minase "Ohhh..."

[MSG$019EE3,40]
The sensation makes me tremble all over.

[MSG$019F18,28]
Nonogusa "Do you like that?"

[MSG$019F4E,77]
I'm blown away by the stimulation...it's nothing like when I do it to myself.

[MSG$019FA8,31]
Shlup, shlup, shlup............

[MSG$019FD4,51]
Nonogusa, is carried away by what she's doing also.

[MSG$01A014,90]
Thanks to the sweet rhythm of the friction from her hand, my pleasure reaches new heights.

[MSG$01A073,71]
Since I can't control the stimulation, I'm suddenly ready to ejaculate.

[MSG$01A0BF,23]
Uh-oh, this isn't good.

[MSG$01A0E3,45]
Minase "Don't do it so hard, or I'll come..."

[MSG$01A12B,17]
Minase "Ohhhh..."

[MSG$01A1CF,98]
I do everything I can to hold it back, but to no avail. I release the torrents of semen inside me.

[MSG$01A23E,15]
Nonogusa "Huh?"

[MSG$01A2E0,15]
Ejaculating...!

[MSG$01A2FC,69]
At that moment, a stream of white liquid spurts onto Nonogusa's face.

[MSG$01A34E,22]
Shooting out liquid...

[MSG$01A371,83]
My testicles are pushed upward, and the semen is milked out of them, over and over.

[MSG$01A3C9,73]
It goes on for quite a while, probably because I was aroused for so long.

[MSG$01A41F,111]
I stare at my own semen squirting noisily against Nonogusa's face, and give in to the sweet pleasure of it all.

[MSG$01A49B,25]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$01A4C1,65]
Nonogusa never stops what she's doing even while I'm ejaculating.

[MSG$01A507,65]
With every pump of her hands, the semen in my urethra sprays out.

[MSG$01A647,42]
When I'm finished at last, I heave a sigh.

[MSG$01A676,61]
I messed up. I actually came before I even got it inside her.

[MSG$01A6C0,31]
Nonogusa "That was a lot, huh?"

[MSG$01A6F9,73]
She scoops up some of the semen on her body and licks it with her tongue.

[MSG$01A74F,23]
Nonogusa "Weird taste."

[MSG$01A780,15]
Minase "Sorry."

[MSG$01A7A9,72]
I look at the vast amount of semen I've sprayed her with, and apologize.

[MSG$01A7FE,92]
Nonogusa "That's all right, it's just my swim suit anyway. I'll get cleaned up in the pool."

[MSG$01A874,28]
That's kind of gross, too...

[MSG$01A89D,53]
Nonogusa "Do you want to try it again, the real way?"

[MSG$01A8EC,66]
She's considerate enough to say this, seeing my still-erect penis.

[MSG$01A933,83]
It's embarrassing, but even after that massive ejaculation, my prick is still hard.

[MSG$01A993,29]
Minase "If you don't mind..."

[MSG$01A9CA,27]
I climb on top of Nonogusa.

[MSG$01AA6F,33]
Nonogusa "Go ahead, stick it in."

[MSG$01AAAA,41]
Nonogusa "It's not my first time, but..."

[MSG$01AAED,46]
Hearing this, I place my penis on her crevice.

[MSG$01AB28,15]
Minase "Ready?"

[MSG$01AB51,43]
I see her nod, then thrust my hips forward.

[MSG$01AC02,12]
Insertion...

[MSG$01AC1B,91]
Probably because there's still some lotion in there, my penis slips inside her like butter.

[MSG$01AC83,16]
Nonogusa "Ahhh!"

[MSG$01ACAD,109]
As I thrust forward, my penis is enveloped by her hot flesh. Since I've just ejaculated, I'm extra-sensitive,

[MSG$01AD1F,46]
and the intense pleasure nearly blows me away.

[MSG$01AD5A,62]
I stop thrusting when I penetrate her up the base of my penis.

[MSG$01AD9D,88]
I can feel her body temperature between my legs. It feels gentle as well as stimulating.

[MSG$01AE02,42]
Nonogusa "You can move. It won't hurt me."

[MSG$01AE46,24]
I start grinding slowly.

[MSG$01AE6B,30]
Nonogusa "Ahhh...ahhh...ahhh!"

[MSG$01AEA3,72]
Nonogusa's breasts--just the right size--jiggle in time with my thrusts.

[MSG$01AEF0,70]
I watch the way her breasts move as I continue with my clumsy thrusts.

[MSG$01AF43,63]
Even though I've just ejaculated, I'm soon ready to come again.

[MSG$01AF8F,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$01AFB7,101]
Every time our bodies rub together, you can hear the lewd sound of our bodily fluids mixing together.

[MSG$01B029,20]
Nonogusa "(heaving)"

[MSG$01B057,88]
Underneath me, Nonogusa is swaying in time to my thrusts, and she lets out a heavy sigh.

[MSG$01B0B4,90]
I gaze down at her. Suddenly my body's racked with an unbearable desire to let it all out.

[MSG$01B11B,38]
Minase "Sorry...I'm gonna come now..."

[MSG$01B15B,39]
I continue grinding as I tell her this.

[MSG$01B18F,51]
Nonogusa "All right...you can just come inside me."

[MSG$01B1DC,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$01B203,53]
Nonogusa "Go ahead...there's nothing to worry about."

[MSG$01B252,69]
Nonogusa "You don't have to hold back...let out as much as you want."

[MSG$01B2B2,77]
As soon as I hear her say this, I'm even more aroused and I come all at once.

[MSG$01B37F,19]
Ejaculating......!!

[MSG$01B39F,79]
I jam my hips against her body, and release everything into her deepest depths.

[MSG$01B3FB,16]
Nonogusa "Ahhh!"

[MSG$01B425,81]
Nonogusa goes rigid from her first experience of feeling someone come inside her.

[MSG$01B4F6,20]
Come shooting out...

[MSG$01B517,100]
At the same time I feel my penis tighten, and after throbbing against her a few times, I continue to

[MSG$01B580,29]
|release my semen inside her.

[MSG$01B5AA,103]
When everything that had been pent-up inside of me is finally spent, I slowly remove my penis from her.

[MSG$01B697,87]
As soon as I pull out, all the semen that's pooled inside her vagina comes pouring out.

[MSG$01B6F3,76]
It's a lot of semen, and it's all frothy. It drips down and soils the floor.

[MSG$01B74C,28]
Nonogusa "(heavy breathing)"

[MSG$01B782,45]
Nonogusa is exhausted, her shoulders heaving.

[MSG$01B7BC,21]
Nonogusa "Thank you."

[MSG$01B7EB,62]
So saying, she straightens her swim suit and stands up slowly.

[MSG$01B82E,30]
I put my uniform back on, too.

[MSG$01B96D,43]
Nonogusa "I don't know, I feel better now."

[MSG$01B9B2,47]
I can see that her face does look more relaxed.

[MSG$01B9EE,106]
Minase "Okay, just like I promised, I'm going to bring those two to justice for treating you so horribly."

[MSG$01BA72,36]
Nonogusa "What are you going to do?"

[MSG$01BAB0,81]
Minase "Hey, just wait and see. I'm going to get those photos back for you, too."

[MSG$01BB1B,27]
I smirk as I tell her this.

[MSG$01BB43,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$01BBF8,85]
Then I leave her there in the classroom. I head toward the swim team's changing room.

[MSG$01BC5A,48]
I know they're not going to be back for a while.

[MSG$01BC8F,62]
I approach the changing room, and put my hand on the doorknob.

[MSG$01BCDA,8]
Click...

[MSG$01BD6B,24]
Minase "Is anyone here?"

[MSG$01BD9D,93]
I whisper these words to make sure no one's inside, then I go in and lock the door behind me.

[MSG$01BE07,72]
At the same time, I lock the door on the other side leading to the pool.

[MSG$01BE54,23]
Now no one can come in.

[MSG$01BE78,25]
Then I get right to work.

[MSG$01BE9E,82]
I search for their lockers and look inside. Their lockers aren't locked. Actually,

[MSG$01BEF5,44]
the locks on most of the lockers are broken.

[MSG$01BF2E,45]
I find their bags right inside their lockers.

[MSG$01BF6E,21]
April 22 - Punishment

[MSG$01BF8B,37]
Minase "I'll show you how it's done."

[MSG$01BFCA,45]
So saying, I drop my pants and approach them.

[MSG$01C080,52]
Kobayashi "What the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$01C0CE,20]
Mikimoto "No, stop!"

[MSG$01C0FC,66]
Minase "You just did something like this to Nonogusa, didn't you?"

[MSG$01C158,78]
Kobayashi "What the...? Don't tell me that little bitch put you up to this..."

[MSG$01C1C0,86]
Minase "Good question...anyway, if you guys don't want these pictures all over school,

[MSG$01C21B,26]
you'd better do as I say."

[MSG$01C24F,58]
So saying, I push my erect penis against Kobayashi's anus.

[MSG$01C28E,107]
These two are in need of severe punishment. I don't think even what I'm about to do to them will be enough.

[MSG$01C306,28]
Kobayashi "Not...not there!"

[MSG$01C33C,17]
Kobayashi "Augh!"

[MSG$01C3E0,64]
Without hesitation, I force my swollen penis up her narrow anus.

[MSG$01C42D,16]
(shoving noises)

[MSG$01C44A,17]
Kobayashi "Augh!"

[MSG$01C475,51]
Kobayashi shudders as she tries to endure the pain.

[MSG$01C4AD,115]
Kobayashi's so hot inside I feel like I'm going to burn myself. It's a nice, tight fit and it makes me even harder.

[MSG$01C52D,102]
Minase "Hey, let's see some action from your groin. Or else you're going to be all lonely down there."

[MSG$01C5AD,43]
Kobayashi "Augh! Take...take it out of me!"

[MSG$01C5F2,74]
Minase "But I just put it in. You've got to do a little better than that."

[MSG$01C656,42]
So saying, I start moving my penis slowly.

[MSG$01C68D,41]
Kobayashi "Stop...stop moving like that!"

[MSG$01C6D0,16]
(shoving noises)

[MSG$01C6ED,43]
Mikimoto "Stop doing that to her...please!"

[MSG$01C732,53]
Kobayashi "Augh! Augh! I can't...I can't hold it in!"

[MSG$01C80A,7]
Splash!

[MSG$01C81E,16]
Mikimoto "Augh!"

[MSG$01C848,15]
Kobayashi "NO!"

[MSG$01C871,63]
The stimulation causes Kobayashi to lose control of her bowels.

[MSG$01C8BD,56]
A hot spray gushes out from between the two girls' legs,

[MSG$01C8FA,74]
and the steaming liquid splashes Mikimoto's body before soiling the floor.

[MSG$01C951,21]
Kobayashi "No way..."

[MSG$01C980,82]
Kobayashi is red-faced; she tries to endure the humiliation of what just happened.

[MSG$01C9DF,44]
Minase "Oh, man. What a tough clean-up job."

[MSG$01CA25,73]
I whisper this nonsense as I continue to mercilessly ram Kobayashi's ass.

[MSG$01CA7B,29]
Kobayashi "Augh! Ohhh! Augh!"

[MSG$01CAB2,21]
Mikimoto "(grunting)"

[MSG$01CAE1,110]
With each thrust, Kobayashi and Mikimoto's body rub against each other, and this starts to make Mikimoto pant.

[MSG$01CB5C,27]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$01CBFD,49]
Mikimoto "Ahhh...that's good...that feels great!"

[MSG$01CC48,41]
Kobayashi "Augh! Hey, my butt feels hot!"

[MSG$01CC8B,61]
The two girls start moaning with pleasure each time I thrust.

[MSG$01CCCD,81]
Despite all her protests, even Kobayashi starts to enjoy being rammed up the ass.

[MSG$01CD2B,60]
Every time I pull out, my penis gets squeezed by her rectum,

[MSG$01CD6C,39]
and it's enough to take my breath away.

[MSG$01CDA0,70]
The unbearably tight quarters get me ready to come almost immediately.

[MSG$01CDF3,39]
Mikimoto "I'm...I'm going to come now."

[MSG$01CE34,26]
Kobayashi "Me...me too..."

[MSG$01CE68,29]
Minase "I'm gonna come, too."

[MSG$01CE9F,85]
Greedily, all three of us ram our bodies against each other, and climax in one burst.

[MSG$01CF01,23]
Squish! Squish! Squish!

[MSG$01CF25,33]
Kobayashi "AHHH! I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$01CF60,27]
Mikimoto "I can't hold it!"

[MSG$01CF95,16]
Minase "Ohhh..."

[MSG$01D038,70]
At the moment of ejaculation, I pull my penis out of Kobayashi's anus.

[MSG$01D08B,18]
Kobayashi "Ugh..."

[MSG$01D130,34]
Glub, glub, glub...squish! squish!

[MSG$01D15F,83]
All three of us climax at the same time, and we lie there, trembling with pleasure.

[MSG$01D1B7,75]
Drunk with ecstasy from all the stimulation, I come all over the two girls.

[MSG$01D20F,45]
Kobayashi's ass is soon soiled with my semen.

[MSG$01D241,59]
Each another shot of my come hits her, Kobayashi convulses.

[MSG$01D289,18]
Minase "(heaving)"

[MSG$01D2B5,87]
I'm panting as I stare at the two girls, now sticky with the fluids I've just released.

[MSG$01D319,48]
Kobayashi "Hey...now give us back those photos."

[MSG$01D363,72]
As I start to put my pants back on, Kobayashi whispers to me, exhausted.

[MSG$01D3B8,77]
Kobayashi "Come on, we went this far for you, so you should be okay with it."

[MSG$01D41F,41]
Minase "I guess I have no choice...Here."

[MSG$01D4EB,89]
I choose the worst picture out of the batch I just took, and toss it at Kobayashi's feet.

[MSG$01D551,42]
Kobayashi "Just one? What about the rest?"

[MSG$01D595,90]
Minase "You got a problem with this? You should be thankful I'm even giving you one back!"

[MSG$01D609,35]
Kobayashi "I don't believe this..."

[MSG$01D646,33]
Kobayashi is stunned by my words.

[MSG$01D674,45]
Minase "You brought it on yourself...See ya!"

[MSG$01D6BB,21]
Kobayashi "No, wait!"

[MSG$01D6EA,58]
I leave them with those words and beat it out of the room.

[MSG$01D729,49]
The girls are both naked and can't come after me.

[MSG$01D802,42]
Moron, as if I'd hand them over so easily!

[MSG$01D839,44]
Sorry, girls, but this is divine punishment.

[MSG$01D86A,46]
I decide to hold onto the photos as insurance.

[MSG$01D8A5,71]
As long as no one else gets their hands on them it should be all right,

[MSG$01D8F1,64]
and if I want to enjoy them privately, then I have the right to.

[MSG$01D936,75]
I'm just going to let them squirm with fear. That's just what they deserve.

[MSG$01D98E,88]
I take the photos from my pocket, and separate Nonogusa's from Kobayashi and Mikimoto's.

[MSG$01D9EB,46]
I intended to give Nonogusa her photos back...

[MSG$01DA26,34]
But then I stop and think it over.

[MSG$01DA55,49]
Who says I have to just hand them over like that?

[MSG$01DA8B,81]
Photos like these aren't easy to come by. I might as well keep some for myself...

[MSG$01DAE9,72]
I then pick out a few of the best photos and put them away in my pocket.

[MSG$01DB36,44]
I'm sure she won't notice a few are missing.

[MSG$01DB6F,17]
April 22 - Photos

[MSG$01DC65,98]
On my way back to the classroom where she'd been tortured, I spot Nonogusa trudging down the hall.

[MSG$01DCD4,83]
She has a totally blank look on her face, she's stumbling along like a sleepwalker.

[MSG$01DD34,62]
But as soon as she sees me, she comes running in my direction.

[MSG$01DDB1,18]
Nonogusa "Minase!"

[MSG$01DDDD,41]
Nonogusa "The photos...did you get them?"

[MSG$01DE20,52]
Minase "Oh yeah, I got them back, just like I said."

[MSG$01DE6E,33]
Hearing this, her face brightens.

[MSG$01DECE,31]
Nonogusa "For real? Thank you!"

[MSG$01DF07,14]
Minase "Here."

[MSG$01DF2F,61]
I take Nonogusa's photos from my pocket and hand them to her.

[MSG$01DF79,21]
Nonogusa "Thank you!"

[MSG$01DFDA,18]
Nonogusa "Wait..."

[MSG$01E006,65]
Nonogusa's face darkens a little as she looks through the photos.

[MSG$01E054,30]
Nonogusa "Weren't there more?"

[MSG$01E08C,33]
Damn...don't tell me she noticed?

[MSG$01E0BA,36]
Minase "Yeah, that's all I found..."

[MSG$01E0F8,66]
I frantically try to keep my composure. Maybe I took too many out?

[MSG$01E147,39]
Nonogusa "Oh, really? Well, thank you."

[MSG$01E188,43]
Nonogusa doesn't look completely convinced,

[MSG$01E1B8,51]
She puts them away in her pocket and bows her head.

[MSG$01E1F8,59]
Minase "And I warned those two not to come near you again."

[MSG$01E24D,18]
Nonogusa "Okay..."

[MSG$01E279,34]
Minase "Okay, I'm going home now."

[MSG$01E2B5,14]
Nonogusa "..."

[MSG$01E2F4,52]
I avert my eyes from Nonogusa's gaze, and hurry off.

[MSG$01E335,95]
That was close. I have a feeling she's onto me, but it's too late for me to give them back now.

[MSG$01E399,70]
Oh well, as long as no one else sees them there shouldn't be any harm.

[MSG$01E3EC,84]
I make sure I don't get spotted by Imari as I rush off school grounds and head home.

[MSG$01E44D,21]
April 22 - Night/Home

[MSG$01E576,79]
As soon as I get home, I head for my room and set the Book of Magic on my desk.

[MSG$01E5D8,50]
I head to my room and hide the photos in a drawer.

[MSG$01E60F,82]
If Imari ever finds them there'll be hell to pay. So I lock the drawer to be safe.

[MSG$01E66E,85]
After I've had dinner and taken a shower, I sit at my desk and open my Book of Magic.

[MSG$01E6C8,65]
I still haven't translated even a third of the Book of Magic yet.

[MSG$01E792,52]
I start translating, just as I had the previous day.

[MSG$01E7CB,53]
Now I know without a doubt that this book is genuine.

[MSG$01E80D,82]
As I head deeper into the book, I find more and more powerful and alluring spells.

[MSG$01E864,81]
I turn the pages like a person obsessed as I search for the most effective spell.

[MSG$01E8C2,63]
I'm looking for information on that ceremony from 12 years ago.

[MSG$01E90E,111]
My gut tells me that this ceremony is the most powerful and exalted one in the whole book. I'm convinced it is.

[MSG$01E98A,59]
Turning the pages, I look for the page about that ceremony.

[MSG$01E9CA,61]
Although I'm also anxious to get into the core of the book...

[MSG$01EA14,116]
After I've turned a good number of pages and scanned numerous subject headings, I finally find what I'm looking for.

[MSG$01EB0D,108]
At first I just notice that there are small stains here and there on the page that I haven't seen elsewhere.

[MSG$01EB7E,40]
I read the title at the top of the page.

[MSG$01EBB3,29]
Minase "Gate-Opening Ritual?"

[MSG$01EBEA,46]
There's something written in Latin at the top.

[MSG$01EC25,71]
"intrate per angustam portam quia lata porta et spatiosa via quae ducit

[MSG$01EC71,50]
|ad perditionem et multi sunt qui intrant per eam.

[MSG$01ECB0,84]
quam angusta porta et arta via quae ducit ad vitam et pauci sunt qui in veniunt eam.

[MSG$01ED11,71]
adtendite a falsis prophetis qui veniunt ad vos in vestimentis ovium in

[MSG$01ED5D,35]
|trinsecus autem sunt lupi rapaces.

[MSG$01ED8D,77]
''Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way,

[MSG$01EDDF,68]
|that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

[MSG$01EE30,106]
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

[MSG$01EE9F,106]
|Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.''

[MSG$01EF16,46]
And below that, the text explained the ritual.

[MSG$01EF51,49]
''Thou shalt open the gates if thou hast courage.

[MSG$01EF87,55]
And I shall summon for thee a powerful army of wraiths,

[MSG$01EFC3,58]
|and thou shalt command them. And I shall bestow upon thee

[MSG$01F002,65]
|the power to do as you wish. In the name of the Father, the Son,

[MSG$01F048,59]
and the Holy Ghost, thou shalt become the Lord of Hell...''

[MSG$01F090,37]
Minase "This is it...it's got to be!"

[MSG$01F0CF,35]
It was a spell to summon a demon...

[MSG$01F0F7,62]
Clearly, it was for a different purpose than the other spells.

[MSG$01F142,40]
If this really was the page in question,

[MSG$01F16F,93]
then these stains are probably blood. And they're also proof that this was the last ritual...

[MSG$01F1D9,59]
I immediately start reading about this Gate-Opening Ritual.

[MSG$01F221,78]
I can see that there are all these methods and liturgies for summoning demons.

[MSG$01F274,68]
A ritual to open the gate to the Underworld, and summon the Devil...

[MSG$01F2C5,76]
It's a fact that those students from 12 years ago died during this ritual...

[MSG$01F316,55]
What on earth happened that day, and what did they see?

[MSG$01F352,40]
Right now I don't have the least idea...

[MSG$01F387,41]
I start summarizing the page, bit by bit.

[MSG$01F3BD,86]
I can see that the page covers everything from how to draw the symbols for the ritual,

[MSG$01F418,36]
to a list of the relevant liturgies,

[MSG$01F441,33]
and finally the necessary chants.

[MSG$01F46F,90]
The symbol is a basic diagram of a circle and a triangle; it has God's name written on it.

[MSG$01F4CE,69]
It's the same one I found written on the floor of that basement room.

[MSG$01F520,96]
The ritual was carried out according to this book. If that's the case, then did the ritual fail?

[MSG$01F585,54]
Or else, could the instructions in this book be wrong?

[MSG$01F5C8,59]
Well, I wasn't going to find out just by thinking about it.

[MSG$01F608,85]
The ritual was held 12 years ago, and the result was what I'd seen in the basement...

[MSG$01F662,29]
That's all I know for a fact.

[MSG$01F704,97]
I immersed myself in translating everything about the ritual, and making a set of detailed notes.

[MSG$01F772,86]
If what the book claimed was true, then one could obtain the greatest power and wisdom

[MSG$01F7CD,18]
|there ever was...

[MSG$01F7EC,62]
The Forbidden Fruit...that's exactly the kind of power it was.

[MSG$01F837,36]
And if I could get my hands on it...

[MSG$01F860,111]
I might be able to command the kind of power and wisdom that would make this book of magic seem like nothing...

[MSG$01F8DC,91]
I lose all rationale with this thought, and continue my work, not even stopping to sleep...
