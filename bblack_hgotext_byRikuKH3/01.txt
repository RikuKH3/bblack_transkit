Ditch it, of course

[MSG$00036B,31]
Ask her to strike a bolder pose

[MSG$0003A7,27]
Just make her strip at once

[MSG$0003FF,14]
Think about it

Feature

[MSG$0009C2,18]
April 20 - Morning

[MSG$000A40,18]
Voice "Wake up..."

[MSG$000A6C,67]
Through the haze of my drowsiness, I can hear an angel's whisper...

[MSG$000AB4,38]
But my body is demanding more sleep...

[MSG$000AE7,27]
Voice "Come on, wake up..."

[MSG$000B1C,33]
But I can't let myself be fooled.

[MSG$000B42,17]
This is no angel.

[MSG$000B60,77]
I know that I'm hearing the whispers of a devil sent to interrupt my sleep...

[MSG$000BBA,24]
Voice "Wake up, I said!"

[MSG$000BEC,35]
Voice "Hey you, wake up right now!"

[MSG$000C29,38]
Her tone of voice changes gradually...

[MSG$000C5C,16]
Voice "HEY YOU!"

[MSG$000C86,22]
Rustle, rustle, rustle

[MSG$000CA9,66]
She must've run out of patience. Now she's using physical tactics.

[MSG$000CF0,87]
The demon has been unmasked, and is now baring her fangs towards this unfortunate lamb.

[MSG$000DE4,15]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$000E0D,14]
Oh, shut up...

[MSG$000E20,54]
I rolled over in bed, and tried frantically to escape,

[MSG$000E63,24]
This is really annoying!

[MSG$000E88,92]
No, actually it's more than annoying, it's torture! No, it's a bona fide crime, that's what!

[MSG$000EF1,23]
I do my best to resist.

[MSG$000F15,100]
This is a moment of pure joy for me...when I'm dozing off. It's unforgivable of her to disrupt that.

[MSG$000F7E,41]
This is the moment that I savor each day.

[MSG$00102D,73]
That moment when you wake up for the first time, then go back to sleep...

[MSG$00107B,31]
There's just nothing like it...

[MSG$0010A7,63]
Like a fetus in amniotic fluid...it's a world of utter peace...

[MSG$0010F3,42]
Voice "For heaven's sake, I said WAKE UP!"

[MSG$001137,57]
At the sound of that voice, I lose gravity in an instant.

[MSG$001279,4]
Bam!

[MSG$00130E,9]
(rolling)

[MSG$0013A8,6]
Whack!

[MSG$0013BB,14]
Minase "AUGH!"

[MSG$0013E3,71]
The all-too-realistic pain instantly drags me back into the real world.

[MSG$001437,24]
Minase "OW OW OW OW OW!"

[MSG$001469,110]
I get up, rubbing my sore head, which feels like it just rolled across the floor and thumped against the wall.

[MSG$001582,35]
Minase "Hey, what's the big idea?!"

[MSG$0015BF,53]
I yell at the girl standing before me, hands on hips.

[MSG$001601,36]
Only one person would be so violent.

[MSG$001632,51]
Her name is Kurumi Imari, She's a neighbor of mine,

[MSG$001672,103]
Imari and I go way back. I've known her since kindergarten, We're what you'd call ''childhood friends''

[MSG$0016DE,35]
|And now we're classmates, as well.

[MSG$00170E,77]
She's taken advantage of the fact that my parents asked her to look after me;

[MSG$001760,73]
now it's part of her daily routine to disrupt my sleep, The little devil!

[MSG$0017B6,94]
True, I'm not a morning person, and it's all thanks to Imari that I'm never late for school...

[MSG$001819,102]
So I can't tell her to knock it off if I wanted to...but it's still annoying. I can't stop it, though.

[MSG$00188C,37]
It's what they call a necessary evil.

[MSG$0018BE,30]
Imari "It's morning. MORNING!"

[MSG$0018F6,50]
So says Imari, thrusting her finger at the window.

[MSG$00192D,54]
It's light outside. True, it does seems to be morning.

[MSG$001970,29]
Minase "Hey, I can see that."

[MSG$0019A7,42]
I answer her in a disgusted tone of voice.

[MSG$0019D6,75]
Gradually I begin to wake up. But does she have to wake me up so violently?

[MSG$001A2E,46]
I yawn and look over at Imari with dazed eyes.

[MSG$001A69,42]
Imari "There you go. All right, let's go!"

[MSG$001AAD,83]
I sit there sleepily rubbing my eyes. Imari barks out her orders to me mercilessly.

[MSG$001B0D,30]
Minase "What about breakfast?"

[MSG$001B45,44]
I scratch my head and speak to Imari's back.

[MSG$001B7E,49]
Hearing me, Imari snorts and points to the clock.

[MSG$001BBC,46]
Imari "As if we had time to sit down and eat!"

[MSG$001C04,30]
Minase "All right, all right,"

[MSG$001C3C,95]
I concede reluctantly, then start taking off the sweatshirt I wear to sleep instead of pajamas.

[MSG$001CA8,48]
Seeing this, Imari quickly turns her back on me.

[MSG$001D09,37]
Imari "Let me know when you're done."

[MSG$001D48,14]
Minase "Sure,"

[MSG$001D70,50]
This is what usually happens, so she's used to it.

[MSG$001DA7,79]
When you have a long history with someone, this sort of thing doesn't faze you.

[MSG$001E03,27]
Minase "Where's my sister?"

[MSG$001E38,53]
I'm changing my clothes as I ask Imari this question.

[MSG$001E7A,119]
I live in this house with my older sister. I call her my sister, although she's really my cousin. But since we've grown

[MSG$001EF6,74]
|up together, due to family circumstances, she's just like a sister to me.

[MSG$001F4D,82]
My parents aren't living with us right now because my dad got transferred at work.

[MSG$001FAC,46]
The transfer happened all of sudden last year.

[MSG$001FDF,102]
My sister and I thought about whether we should go along, then decided to stay here because of school.

[MSG$002052,110]
I thought it would be the start of good times for me, getting away from my overbearing parents...but my sister

[MSG$0020C5,35]
|and Imari keep getting in the way.

[MSG$0020F5,73]
My folks even entrusted Imari with the task of waking me up every morning

[MSG$002143,59]
|and keeping an eye on me in general. How annoying is that?

[MSG$002183,36]
And Imari has been true to her word.

[MSG$0021B4,59]
Imari "Oh, Yukiko? She was on her way out when I got here,"

[MSG$002209,18]
Minase "Oh, yeah?"

[MSG$002235,101]
Big Sister Yukiko, even though she's a graduate student, actually leaves the house earlier than I do.

[MSG$00229F,72]
Of course, it's not to go to class, but because she has a part-time job.

[MSG$0022F4,72]
Imari "I really wish you'd try to follow your sister's example, Minase."

[MSG$002356,63]
Imari can say that because she doesn't know about Yukiko's job.

[MSG$0023A2,67]
Imari "All right! Stop all this chatting and get yourself dressed."

[MSG$002422,98]
I take off all my clothes except my shorts, then call out to Imari, who still has her back turned.

[MSG$002491,33]
Minase "You can turn around now."

[MSG$0024CC,81]
Imari "That was quick. If only you'd be as efficient about getting out of bed..."

[MSG$002537,39]
So saying, she turns around to face me.

[MSG$00259D,12]
Imari "Ugh!"

[MSG$0025C3,21]
Minase "You pervert!"

[MSG$0025F2,24]
Imari's face is all red.

[MSG$00260F,41]
She's embarrassed, all right. Cool, cool.

[MSG$002645,22]
Quiver, quiver, quiver

[MSG$002668,22]
Her hand is trembling.

[MSG$002683,48]
Wait, she's not embarrassed...She's mad as hell!

[MSG$0026B8,54]
Her face is bright red, and her temples are throbbing.

[MSG$00272D,18]
Imari "You moron!"

[MSG$00281B,6]
SMACK!

[MSG$00282E,45]
Her hand goes up and smashes against my face.

[MSG$002860,22]
Now I'm totally awake.

[MSG$002883,107]
Imari "This is no time for lame pranks! I'm waiting for you, for Pete's sake, so hurry up and get dressed!"

[MSG$00292C,50]
Imari spits these words out and pivots once again.

[MSG$00296B,59]
Minase "You didn't have to hit me with your freakin' fist!"

[MSG$0029C0,48]
Imari has no tolerance for these types of jokes.

[MSG$0029F5,51]
I change into my uniform, muttering the whole time.

[MSG$002A40,83]
If I keep her waiting any longer, she'll go wild, so I try to be as quick as I can.

[MSG$002AA0,50]
I toss aside my nightwear and get into my uniform.

[MSG$002AD7,57]
Then I check my look in the mirror and call out to Imari.

[MSG$002B1D,26]
Minase "You can look now."

[MSG$002B83,13]
Imari "Good."

[MSG$002BAA,45]
She turns around to face me as she says this.

[MSG$002BE4,74]
Imari "Okay, then go wash your face. I'll be waiting for you at the door."

[MSG$002C48,16]
Minase "Gotcha."

[MSG$002CFB,66]
I did as she said and quickly brushed my teeth and washed my face.

[MSG$002D4A,60]
I can't believe how bossy she is. It's like I'm in prison...

[MSG$002D8B,72]
That Imari...she probably thinks the whole universe revolves around her.

[MSG$002E31,26]
April 20 - Going to school

[MSG$002ED6,75]
Imari and I leave the house and set off side by side, headed toward school.

[MSG$002F2E,106]
Of course, it's embarrassing for me to have to walk to school with this girl, even if we grew up together.

[MSG$002F9D,81]
But since she came over just to wake me up, I can't just say ''Thanks, goodbye!''

[MSG$002FF3,56]
|I have no choice but to do the obvious and go with her.

[MSG$003038,77]
Even though she rushed me, we still have plenty of time before classes start.

[MSG$00308A,60]
We can get there by the first bell even if we take our time.

[MSG$0030D3,88]
Even so, it's better for me this way...this early, not many people will see us together.

[MSG$003138,14]
Minase "YAWN."

[MSG$003160,67]
As I walk the familiar route to school, I let out an enormous yawn.

[MSG$0031A8,63]
It's still early, and I don't see any other people from school.

[MSG$0031F4,28]
Imari "You're still sleepy?"

[MSG$00322A,94]
So asks Imari, turning to look at my face, after I let loose with another yawn to show her up.

[MSG$003295,60]
Minase "That's right, because Somebody forced me to get up!"

[MSG$0032EB,73]
Imari "If I hadn't woken you up, you'd go on sleeping for hours, Minase."

[MSG$00334E,24]
She has a point there...

[MSG$003373,76]
Imari "Remember that time when I couldn't make it to your place one morning?

[MSG$0033C4,54]
|You were still asleep when I went over after school!"

[MSG$003415,81]
Imari "I can't believe anyone could sleep that long. Your eyes are going to rot."

[MSG$003480,73]
Minase "If that's all it would take, they'd have rotted long ago by now."

[MSG$0034E3,19]
Imari "Is that so!"

[MSG$003561,22]
April 20 - School Gate

[MSG$0035F6,68]
We walk for about 10 minutes, then we reach our familiar old school.

[MSG$00363F,61]
We walk through the gate. The place is still pretty deserted.

[MSG$003689,107]
When it's time for the first bell, the school counselor shuts the gate and checks off who's coming in late.

[MSG$003701,105]
It's just like Judgment Day. As the gate's about to close, you see a herd of students swarming towards it

[MSG$00376F,17]
|like lost souls.

[MSG$00378D,52]
Fortunately, thanks to Imari, I'm never one of them.

[MSG$0037C6,58]
If you're late twice, they take a day off your attendance.

[MSG$003805,70]
If I didn't have Imari to wake me up, I'd probably lose a few credits.

[MSG$0038A9,18]
April 20 - Lockers

[MSG$00395D,69]
Imari "We got here pretty early. You think we're the only ones here?"

[MSG$0039BC,101]
Imari looks around at the row of lockers. She takes her school shoes from her locker and puts them on

[MSG$003A26,26]
|as she makes this remark.

[MSG$003A4D,92]
|True, there are hardly any other school shoes to be seen. Not that there aren't any at all.

[MSG$003AAE,38]
The kids who come for morning practice

[MSG$003AD9,86]
|get here at least an hour before we do. But since morning practice is still going on,

[MSG$003B34,43]
they haven't arrived in the classrooms yet.

[MSG$003B6C,18]
Minase "Beats me."

[MSG$003B98,70]
I grab my own school shoes from my locker and slam them to the ground.

[MSG$003BE3,68]
The heels have gone flat. I stick my feet into these pathetic shoes.

[MSG$003C34,27]
Minase "Who cares, anyway?"

[MSG$003C69,41]
We still have time before the first bell.

[MSG$003C97,62]
At this hour, there are never that many kids in the classroom.

[MSG$003CDA,51]
Rush hour always starts after the preliminary bell.

[MSG$003D1A,68]
It's not often that Imari and I are the first ones in the classroom.

[MSG$003D63,93]
I don't know whether that's because we're early, or the others are late. Probably the latter.

[MSG$003DCD,100]
But if I had the choice, I'd rather join the latter. It would be good to sleep till the last minute.

[MSG$003E36,47]
That's really more in keeping with my nature...

[MSG$003E72,105]
After changing our shoes, Imari and I leave the lockers and head toward our classroom on the 3rd floor...

[MSG$003F39,20]
April 20 - Classroom

[MSG$003FCB,22]
Ito "Is it all right?"

[MSG$003FFC,13]
Murai "Sure."

[MSG$004024,51]
Murai "But you know what, someone might be coming!"

[MSG$004072,20]
Ito "Shh, be quiet!"

[MSG$0040A1,18]
Ito "Okay, Saeki."

[MSG$00414E,40]
Saeki "All right, I'm going to do it..."

[MSG$004191,85]
The girl in the middle named Saeki concentrates hard, then her lips begin to tremble.

[MSG$0041F3,15]
Saeki "Atah..."

[MSG$00421D,18]
Saeki "Malkuth..."

[MSG$00424A,20]
Saeki "V'Geburah..."

[MSG$004279,20]
Saeki "V'Gedulah..."

[MSG$0042A8,18]
Saeki "Liolahm..."

[MSG$0042D5,76]
As the girl intones these mysterious words, she makes the sign of the cross.

[MSG$004326,87]
When she's finished, she picks up a dagger from the desk and pricks her finger with it.

[MSG$00438A,11]
Saeki "Oh!"

[MSG$0043B0,57]
She pushes down with the dagger, which pierces her flesh.

[MSG$0043EE,75]
Drops of blood fall from her finger. She catches them in a cup on the desk.

[MSG$004446,76]
Saeki "This is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins."

[MSG$0044AD,74]
She repeats the prayer from the Last Supper, and continues with her chant.

[MSG$004504,81]
Saeki "Spirits who perished 12 years ago, I summon thee now to give me guidance."

[MSG$00456F,70]
Saeki "So that those who now live in bliss might assuage thy grief..."

[MSG$0045CF,102]
Saeki "I now summon thee to show me all the answers, in the name of the blood Christ shed for thee..."

[MSG$00464F,57]
The students surrounding Saeki are holding their breaths.

[MSG$004695,57]
At that moment, the smoke from the candle began to waver.

[MSG$004756,14]
(Door opening)

[MSG$004771,65]
Just then, the door opens, and the draft extinguishes the candle.

[MSG$0047F1,13]
Murai "AUGH!"

[MSG$004818,30]
Minase "Hey, what's going on?"

[MSG$004850,119]
As soon as we open the door to the classroom, we hear the piercing sound of strange voices. We stand there, speechless.

[MSG$0048CC,51]
We can smell something like incense burning inside.

[MSG$00490C,31]
Imari "What...what's going on?"

[MSG$004945,95]
It's dark inside the classroom. There are black curtains on the windows, blocking the sunlight.

[MSG$0049B1,28]
Murai "You...you scared us!"

[MSG$004A45,48]
Ito "Well, you shouldn't have yelled like that."

[MSG$004A8F,33]
Murai "Ow! I couldn't help it..."

[MSG$004ACA,31]
Minase "Listen, YOU scared US."

[MSG$004B03,114]
I snarl this at the girls gathered in the middle of the classroom, then enter with an exasperated look on my face.

[MSG$004B82,103]
Apparently these girls have been doing something mysterious, gathered around a single desk in the dark.

[MSG$004BEE,63]
|As evidence, there's a whole bunch of weird stuff on the desk.

[MSG$004C3A,82]
Imari "What are you doing? This early in the morning...closing the curtains, too."

[MSG$004CA6,99]
One person remains sitting calmly in front of the desk. It's the leader of this group, Kaori Saeki.

[MSG$004D0E,34]
She's famous for being a wack job.

[MSG$004D3D,120]
She's highly unapproachable, so introverted that she's always reading some weird-looking book at her desk during recess.

[MSG$004DBA,31]
|That's my impression of Saeki.

[MSG$004DE6,57]
Still, for some reason she's very popular with the girls.

[MSG$004E24,72]
She'll often gather a group of girls and show them some freaky ceremony,

[MSG$004E71,66]
|which she calls Black Magic. She seems to get a kick out of that.

[MSG$004EC0,114]
While some people ridicule her for being tasteless, others actually support her. Of course, I'm one of the former.

[MSG$004F3F,82]
I mean, magic and fortune-telling...there's just no scientific foundation to them,

[MSG$004F96,81]
|and they're unproductive. Not something an intelligent person should be doing...

[MSG$00504A,34]
Saeki "Communing with the dead..."

[MSG$005086,92]
Saeki "Since it's almost the night of Walpurgis, we were trying to conjure up the spirits of

[MSG$0050E7,40]
|our forerunners who died 12 years ago."

[MSG$005129,85]
As she speaks, Saeki puts away all the mysterious-looking tools laid out on the desk.

[MSG$005183,110]
The other girls rush to the windows to open the curtains. The room is instantly filled with the morning light.

[MSG$005249,26]
Minase "Forerunners, huh?"

[MSG$00527D,25]
I say this with contempt.

[MSG$0052A3,75]
You're talking about that Black Magic Society they had here 12 years ago...

[MSG$0052F3,41]
the one in all those rumors...aren't you?

[MSG$005329,112]
It was nothing but a ''society,'' which the school didn't see fit to recognize as an officially sanctioned club.

[MSG$00539E,87]
It's not as if I'd heard about it firsthand, and there's no proof that it ever existed.

[MSG$005402,101]
But this Saeki has swallowed that whole occult society rumor, which is still being discussed today...

[MSG$00546C,78]
and apparently she regards the society members with both respect and jealousy.

[MSG$0054C7,65]
Minase "Hey, aren't we a little too old for these ghost stories?"

[MSG$005522,112]
Minase "I can't believe you came to school so early for this stupid business. You must really be into it, then."

[MSG$0055AC,33]
So saying, I try to go past them.

[MSG$0055D2,54]
I don't have the least interest in what they're doing,

[MSG$00560D,65]
and no good will come of getting involved with the likes of them.

[MSG$00568D,23]
Ito "Stupid? How rude!"

[MSG$0056BE,69]
But a girl named Ito has taken offense at my words and blocks my way.

[MSG$005710,46]
Ito "Excuse me, but we're serious about this."

[MSG$005769,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00577C,88]
Ito slams a nearby desk with her hand, all the while fixing me with a flinty-eyed stare.

[MSG$0057D9,69]
There's one in every class, a loudmouthed hysterical girl like Ito...

[MSG$00582B,38]
Minase "Hey, sorry. I didn't mean it."

[MSG$00586B,12]
Ito "Humph!"

[MSG$005939,75]
Murai "You can't blame him, really. He doesn't know how powerful Saeki is."

[MSG$00599E,57]
Murai "And he doesn't know what happened 12 years ago..."

[MSG$0059F1,66]
Murai senses the hostility in the air, and tries to calm Ito down.

[MSG$005A38,90]
Saeki, the girl in question, has been putting the desks back in place, cool as a cucumber.

[MSG$005A9F,73]
The other 2 girls are Saeki's loyal supporters. Ayumi Murai and Mika Ito.

[MSG$005AED,81]
Thanks to Saeki's black magic, these girls believe in fortune-telling and chants.

[MSG$005B4B,99]
True, there are some who believe in Saeki's spells and fortune-telling. Especially among the girls.

[MSG$005BB3,84]
Those are the ones who support Saeki. You know, birds of a feather flock together...

[MSG$005C14,96]
And I've heard some say that they actually work. But I'm sure that's no more than a coincidence.

[MSG$005C81,69]
Minase "The demonic ceremony that was carried out 12 years ago, huh?"

[MSG$005CE0,79]
Minase "That's the kind of rumor you'd find at any school...no way is it true!"

[MSG$005D49,27]
Ito "How can you say that?"

[MSG$005D7E,59]
Minase "There's just no way. Don't tell me you believe it?"

[MSG$005DD3,12]
Ito "Grr..."

[MSG$005E7C,49]
It is then that Saeki finally breaks her silence.

[MSG$005EBA,106]
Saeki "On Walpurgis Night 12 years ago, 6 female students from this school held a Black Magic ceremony..."

[MSG$005F3E,80]
Saeki "And the girls who took part in this ceremony all died mysterious deaths."

[MSG$005FA8,114]
Saeki "Rumor has it that they spouted blood all over the room. They say the room looked like a scene out of Hell."

[MSG$006034,38]
Saeki speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.

[MSG$006067,115]
Sure, there are a lot of variations of this rumor, but the basic storyline is more or less what Saeki just told me.

[MSG$0060E7,58]
There are a lot of other childish rumors about our school.

[MSG$00612E,77]
The ghost that appears in the mirror on the landing of one of the staircases.

[MSG$006180,46]
Stories about the old piano in the Music Room.

[MSG$0061B3,42]
There's an endless supply of such stories.

[MSG$0061EA,93]
But none are as freaky and ridiculous as the one about the Black Magic ceremony 12 years ago.

[MSG$006254,74]
Minase "How can I possibly believe that story? It's nothing but nonsense."

[MSG$0062B8,88]
Minase "And another thing, You say they died, but what was it that killed them, anyway?"

[MSG$00632A,73]
Saeki "That was the Devil's work. Those girls were murdered by demons..."

[MSG$00638D,107]
Saeki "It's not easy to conquer demons. In fact, a lot of people ended up getting killed summoning demons."

[MSG$006412,24]
Saeki answers me calmly.

[MSG$00642F,73]
I don't know how she can utter the word ''demon'' with a straight face...

[MSG$006485,31]
Minase "What a load of crap..."

[MSG$0064BE,79]
Minase "You've been reading too much manga...There's no such thing as a demon."

[MSG$006527,33]
Hearing me, Ito looks infuriated.

[MSG$0065F3,46]
Ito "Then how do you explain the Secret Room?"

[MSG$00663B,83]
Ito "Just as the rumor says...that room has been under lock and key all this time."

[MSG$0066A8,54]
Ito is talking about the storage room in the basement.

[MSG$0066E3,78]
According to the faculty, they store all the unused desks and equipment there.

[MSG$00673E,95]
But it's true that this room hasn't been used in a long time...and it's been locked up forever.

[MSG$0067A2,55]
That's why it's become the subject of countless rumors.

[MSG$0067E6,69]
And because of those rumors, the students are afraid to go near it...

[MSG$006830,89]
and the teachers who have been here a long time seem to want to avoid going down there...

[MSG$006896,92]
Well, not that a storage room is something you use that often...but it is kind of weird that

[MSG$0068F7,36]
|it's been locked tight for so long.

[MSG$006928,77]
Even so, that's no reason to connect that room with ceremonies and the Devil.

[MSG$006982,41]
Minase "It's nothing but a storage room."

[MSG$0069C5,84]
Ito "Yes, but no one's ever seen what's inside, and the teachers refuse to open it."

[MSG$006A33,92]
Ito "It's like it was sealed off 12 years ago...it's been locked up ever since, never used."

[MSG$006AA9,92]
Minase "That's just another rumor. For all we know, they could be using it everyday. Right?"

[MSG$006B1F,42]
Ito "That's just conjecture on your part."

[MSG$006B63,55]
Minase "But it's a lot more realistic than that rumor."

[MSG$006BB4,96]
Ito "No smoke without fire. You're just passing it off as a rumor. But nobody's ever seen it, so

[MSG$006C19,49]
|I'll thank you not to write it off so casually."

[MSG$006D0B,79]
Imari "Come to think of it, I heard something from one of the grad students..."

[MSG$006D74,66]
Imari suddenly broke in, after listening silently to our exchange.

[MSG$006DC3,44]
Minase "Heard something? What did you hear?"

[MSG$006E09,86]
Ito "That there used to be a club called the Rose & Cross Society, a long time ago..."

[MSG$006E79,58]
Minase "Man, don't tell me you believe in that stuff too?"

[MSG$006ECD,27]
I'm exasperated with Imari.

[MSG$006EED,105]
Yeah, well, Imari is a girl too, so I can sort of understand why she might be interested in that stuff...

[MSG$006F63,110]
But if Imari was a believer too, that would make me the only non-believer, and the odds would be against me...

[MSG$006FDE,74]
Imari "No, I don't, but it's true that there used to be a club like that."

[MSG$007042,53]
Minase "What do you mean, true? You're sure of that?"

[MSG$007091,104]
Imari "Someone from the Art Club told me. It wasn't an official club, so there aren't any school records

[MSG$0070FE,77]
|and it's not in any of the yearly albums...but I heard it really did exist."

[MSG$007165,31]
Minase "What about ceremonies?"

[MSG$00719E,67]
Imari "I don't know about that. I wasn't interested enough to ask."

[MSG$0071FB,63]
Minase "So now the story's just getting more complicated, huh?"

[MSG$007254,109]
Minase "Okay, let's just say for argument's sake that there WAS a club like that. But that ceremony business,

[MSG$0072C6,70]
you know they added it onto the rumor later. And forget about demons!"

[MSG$00737C,98]
Ito "Do you really think so? You know what, I think you're really scared of ghost stories, Minase.

[MSG$0073E3,82]
You probably get so scared, you can't bring yourself to go to the bathroom alone."

[MSG$00744F,6]
Grr...

[MSG$007462,66]
Imari "Come to think of it, Minase...remember when we were little,

[MSG$0074A9,58]
watching a horror movie together, and you wet your pants?"

[MSG$0074FD,70]
Imari blurts this out all of a sudden, as if she'd just remembered it.

[MSG$007548,44]
What kind of a blast from the past is that?!

[MSG$007579,89]
Anyway, that happened way back in kindergarten! You don't have to remember that crap NOW.

[MSG$0075DF,61]
Ito "You're actually a sweet little boy, Minase, aren't you?"

[MSG$007636,7]
Damn...

[MSG$00764A,66]
Thanks to Imari and her big mouth, my reputation is now in shreds.

[MSG$007699,47]
Imari "Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned that."

[MSG$0076E2,58]
Imari really does look apologetic as she looks over at me.

[MSG$007721,93]
It's too late for sorry, girl. This is what they mean when they say ''less said the better.''

[MSG$00778B,72]
Ito "Saeki, you try to talk some sense into him, too. He's so stubborn!"

[MSG$0077ED,117]
Saeki had been listening to this conversation all along without a word--as if it had nothing to do with her--but now,

[MSG$007867,48]
at Ito's prodding, she opens her mouth to speak.

[MSG$007942,85]
Saeki "You're free to believe or not to believe. But even if a rumor's beyond belief,

[MSG$00799C,52]
there's always some grain of truth in it, you know."

[MSG$0079EA,80]
Saeki "Until Schliemann discovered Troy, everyone thought that Homer's epic poem

[MSG$007A3F,46]
|The Iliad was nothing but a work of fiction."

[MSG$007A87,85]
Saeki "Same with Machu Picchu. It was thought to be just a legend until Hiram Bingham

[MSG$007AE1,16]
|discovered it."

[MSG$007B0C,109]
Saeki "You can never discount anything as 100% lies or fabrication. Not until you've verified it yourself..."

[MSG$007B93,99]
Well, she does have a point, but that's still no reason to agree that black magic and demons exist.

[MSG$007C35,72]
Ito "She's right, Minase. Like she said just now: no smoke without fire.

[MSG$007C82,99]
You scoff at what you think is a rumor, but rumors don't get started without any evidence at all.."

[MSG$007CFF,79]
Ito "So we'll thank you not to reject this one when you know nothing about it!"

[MSG$007D5B,70]
As soon as she sees she has the upper hand, Ito blurts this out to me.

[MSG$007DA6,50]
You can hear the confidence oozing from her voice.

[MSG$007DE5,77]
Minase "You can say what you want, but a rumor is a rumor. That's all it is."

[MSG$007E4C,108]
I toss this last remark at them and start to walk past them as they fume, so I can get away from this scene.

[MSG$007EC5,102]
Minase "I understand you wanting to believe it. I don't care whether you do or not. But for god's sake

[MSG$007F30,69]
|don't do this weird stuff in our classroom. You're creeping me out."

[MSG$007F8F,63]
Ito "Sour grapes? Why don't you just accept defeat gracefully?"

[MSG$007FE8,17]
Minase "(Snorts)"

[MSG$008013,70]
I ignore Ito, who's still trying to bait me, and walk over to my desk.

[MSG$00805E,94]
I couldn't convince these people otherwise even if we continued the conversation, and besides,

[MSG$0080C1,63]
I have better things to do than hang out with wackos like them.

[MSG$00810D,86]
After a while, our classmates started to pour into the room, and it got a lot noisier.

[MSG$00820E,77]
Murai "I guess we're about done here. The teacher should be showing up soon."

[MSG$008275,50]
And with that, Ito and Saeki and the others leave.

[MSG$008329,10]
Door opens

[MSG$008340,57]
The door opens and the teacher walks in...perfect timing.

[MSG$008386,33]
Imari heads over to her own desk.

[MSG$0083AC,98]
As soon as she sits down, she looks over at me and clasps both her hands in an apologetic gesture.

[MSG$008413,58]
I guess she still feels guilty about what happened before.

[MSG$00845A,50]
As I prepare for class, I try to calm myself down.

[MSG$008499,94]
We never really did resolve the issue, but it won't help to get into a heated debate with Ito.

[MSG$0084FC,82]
And I really didn't give a damn about the basement, or what happened 12 years ago.

[MSG$00855B,81]
I adjust my mindset thus, and immerse myself in class, which was boring as usual.

[MSG$00860A,22]
April 20 - After Class

[MSG$0086A7,18]
..................

[MSG$0086C6,12]
............

[MSG$0086DF,6]
......

[MSG$008703,11]
School Bell

[MSG$00879F,96]
As the final bell rings, the students around me get up from their chairs en masse--released from

[MSG$008804,55]
|class at last--and go about their respective business.

[MSG$008848,105]
Some head for practice...others get ready to go home, while still others head for their part-time jobs...

[MSG$0088BE,76]
And then there are the reluctant few who are dragged off to club meetings...

[MSG$008951,65]
Imari "Hey, you're coming to the club meeting today, aren't you?"

[MSG$0089AC,16]
Here it comes...

[MSG$0089C9,78]
I had just stuffed everything on my desk into my bag, and was about to get up.

[MSG$008A1C,59]
That's when Imari decided to approach - and call out to me.

[MSG$008A64,62]
She does this all the time, but there's nothing more annoying.

[MSG$008AAF,29]
Extracurricular activities...

[MSG$008AD1,108]
I belong to the Art Club.  Out of all the cultural clubs at school (whose members are mostly ghost members),

[MSG$008B42,30]
it's a relatively decent club.

[MSG$008B6D,83]
Imari pretty much forced me to join this club. This was back when we were freshmen,

[MSG$008BC5,78]
and everyone who didn't have an obvious choice had to pick something or other,

[MSG$008C18,45]
That was when Imari recommended the Art Club.

[MSG$008C52,86]
In the beginning, I thought I could get away with just ditching the meetings everyday,

[MSG$008CAD,95]
but thanks to Imari breathing down my neck all the time, I've somehow lasted until senior year.

[MSG$008D19,100]
It's not that I don't like to draw, but I can't stand the idea of spending any of my free time here.

[MSG$008D8A,92]
So I try to ditch every chance I get. But since I've escaped for the last few days in a row,

[MSG$008DEB,26]
Imari's got her eye on me.

[MSG$008E0A,73]
It won't be easy to escape Imari now that she's made a preemptive strike.

[MSG$008E60,34]
Imari "You're coming, aren't you?"

[MSG$008E9C,6]
Ugh...

[MSG$008ECF,38]
Minase "Yeah, all right...I'm coming."

[MSG$008F0F,72]
I didn't think I could argue my way out of it, so I decided to go along.

[MSG$008F5C,87]
Since I'd been ditching the last few days, it wouldn't hurt to show up like she wanted.

[MSG$008FC0,40]
Imari "Huh! You're pretty docile today."

[MSG$009002,88]
Imari "I'm impressed! So now you appreciate how much fun you can have at club meetings?"

[MSG$009074,24]
Minase "In your dreams."

[MSG$0090A6,89]
Imari "Okay, be sure to show up, then. I'm going to go on ahead and unlock the Art Room."

[MSG$009119,20]
Minase "Yes, ma'am."

[MSG$009152,29]
Minase "Uh, I can't today..."

[MSG$009189,66]
I'm not feeling inspired today, either, so I try to get out of it.

[MSG$00920A,80]
Imari "No way, you've got to be kidding! You've been ditching every day lately."

[MSG$009274,74]
Imari "The teacher's annoyed, too. We're seniors, and if we skip meetings,

[MSG$0092C3,57]
we'll be setting a bad example for the younger students."

[MSG$009316,68]
Not that I thought for a moment that she'd just let me go so easily.

[MSG$009367,54]
Minase "Okay, okay. I'll be there if I can make it..."

[MSG$0093B7,31]
Imari "Promise you'll show up!"

[MSG$0093F0,50]
Minase "I promise I'll be there if I can make it."

[MSG$00943C,22]
Quiver, quiver, quiver

[MSG$00945F,43]
My flaky behavior causes Imari's face to...

[MSG$009497,38]
Imari "I said SHOW UP NO MATTER WHAT!"

[MSG$0094D7,54]
Imari scowls fiercely, shouting in total exasperation.

[MSG$009512,97]
At this point there's no placating her unless I show up. If I ignore her there'll be hell to pay.

[MSG$009580,35]
Minase "Okay, okay, I'll be there!"

[MSG$0095BD,73]
It's not what I want, but I know of no other way to escape Imari's wrath.

[MSG$009645,54]
Imari "Why didn't you just say so from the beginning?"

[MSG$009695,72]
Imari "Okay, I'll see you there, I'm going on ahead to unlock the room."

[MSG$0096F7,20]
Minase "Yes, ma'am."

[MSG$009749,76]
To make extra sure, Imari admonishes me one last time, then leaves the room.

[MSG$0097A2,48]
Okay, now that Imari's gone, why don't I just...

[MSG$0097FF,30]
Minase "Guess I'll just go..."

[MSG$009837,52]
Since I told her I'd be there, I can't be a no-show.

[MSG$009870,71]
I pick up my bag, head out to the hallway and walk toward the Art Room.

[MSG$0098E8,35]
Why don't I just ditch after all...

[MSG$009910,93]
It's an old trick of mine, reassuring her that I'll be at the meeting, then promptly fleeing.

[MSG$009972,60]
There's no other way for me to escape from that pesky Imari.

[MSG$0099BB,94]
I mean, what loser would go to these club meetings, when it's not even an absolute obligation?

[MSG$009A1E,52]
Just let the ones who really want to attend show up.

[MSG$009A5F,50]
How naive of you, Imari...believing me so readily.

[MSG$009A96,58]
This is why they teach you not to go along with strangers.

[MSG$009AD5,78]
Not being able to see through me after all these years...you really are naive.

[MSG$009B30,24]
Minase "I'm going home!"

[MSG$009B62,59]
I pick up my bag, humming, and beat it towards the lockers.

[MSG$009BA2,69]
Who gives a crap about club meetings? Those are for morons to attend.

[MSG$009BEC,17]
Hahaha, I'm free!

[MSG$009CF6,45]
Imari "Hey, where do you think you're going?"

[MSG$009D3D,9]
Whoops...

[MSG$009D53,66]
Imari stands with her hands on her hips at the end of the hallway.

[MSG$009DA2,66]
Imari "You weren't planning to go home or anything, now were you?"

[MSG$009DFE,45]
Pretty sharp! Does she have ESP or something?

[MSG$009E38,44]
Minase "Of course not...I'd never...hahaha!"

[MSG$009E7E,32]
Imari "The Art Room's that way."

[MSG$009EB8,81]
Imari stabs her finger in the opposite direction. Her eyes are full of suspicion.

[MSG$009F16,98]
Minase "Hey, come on! You know I wouldn't skip. I was just going to stop by the men's room first."

[MSG$009F92,39]
Imari "The bathrooms are that way too."

[MSG$009FD3,49]
Imari stabs her finger in the opposite direction.

[MSG$00A011,75]
Minase "I just felt like using a different bathroom for once...that's all."

[MSG$00A076,33]
Imari "All right, let's go then."

[MSG$00A0B1,75]
Minase "Yeah, but you know what, I've got a stomachache all of a sudden..."

[MSG$00A116,105]
Minase "And plus, I'm starting to get a fever. I think that curry I ate last night must've been poisoned!

[MSG$00A184,54]
Or else it's that E. coli that's been going around..."

[MSG$00A1D4,47]
Imari "Is that some kind of joke or something?"

[MSG$00A21D,74]
Imari "Or do you actually believe I'd fall for something as lame as that?"

[MSG$00A281,21]
Minase "No, I don't."

[MSG$00A2B0,29]
Imari "Well, then, let's go."

[MSG$00A2E7,20]
Minase "Yes, ma'am."

[MSG$00A315,16]
(skidding noise)

[MSG$00A332,57]
Imari grabs my arm and drags me off towards the Art Room.

[MSG$00A3C9,19]
April 20 - Art Room

[MSG$00A47E,10]
Door opens

[MSG$00A4C7,73]
Still dragging me by the arm, Imari slides open the door to the Art Room.

[MSG$00A515,61]
The Art Club members just use the Art Room for club meetings.

[MSG$00A55F,70]
Minase "Ouch, ouch! You don't have to pull so hard, I won't run away!"

[MSG$00A5BF,110]
Imari "I don't believe you. Just the other day I got distracted for one second and you jumped out the window."

[MSG$00A647,95]
Oh, that's right, I ended up spraining my ankle that time. I was in pain for the next few days.

[MSG$00A6AB,49]
I might as well have just stayed for the meeting.

[MSG$00A6E9,61]
Imari "Come on, you're the Vice President, so look the part!"

[MSG$00A740,99]
Vice President...Come to think of it, we did decide on that stuff at the beginning of the semester.

[MSG$00A7A8,39]
Needless to say, Imari's our President.

[MSG$00A7E2,15]
Door opening...

[MSG$00A89C,38]
I shove open the door to the Art Room.

[MSG$00A8C7,56]
The Art Club members just use the Art Room for meetings.

[MSG$00A90C,26]
Imari "Oh, there you are!"

[MSG$00A940,50]
Imari "So the Vice President is joining us today!"

[MSG$00A98C,64]
Oh, pipe down, will you? I'm here because you kept badgering me!

[MSG$00A9D9,99]
Vice President...Come to think of it, we did decide on that stuff at the beginning of the semester.

[MSG$00AA41,39]
Needless to say, Imari's our President.

[MSG$00AAEA,77]
As I enter the Art Room, the sharp scent of turpentine and petrol assails me.

[MSG$00AB44,76]
There are easels set up all over the room, and everyone has their own canvas

[MSG$00AB95,8]
|set up.

[MSG$00ABAA,105]
The Art Club members who got here before me stand before their easels, sketching away with their brushes.

[MSG$00AC20,75]
There's a school-wide exhibit coming up, so everyone's working pretty hard.

[MSG$00AC78,103]
Needless to say, I'm supposed to enter something myself. But of course I don't have anything ready yet.

[MSG$00AD1E,88]
Imari "All right, since you're here for once, I want you to get some serious work done!"

[MSG$00AD90,24]
Minase "Do you hear me?"

[MSG$00ADC2,78]
I yank out my canvas from my desk drawer, prop it up on my easel and sit down.

[MSG$00AE9A,35]
The canvas in front of me is white.

[MSG$00AEC2,58]
I mean totally white...I mean, I haven't touched it yet...

[MSG$00AF09,15]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$00AF32,8]
I groan.

[MSG$00AF3F,56]
A genius doesn't pick up a brush when he's not inspired.

[MSG$00AF7C,88]
I can't force myself to sketch when I'm not in the mood...that won't generate any ideas.

[MSG$00AFE1,107]
As usual, I get out my pencil case and kneaded eraser. And then I start pulling on the eraser to kill time.

[MSG$00B059,13]
Stretching...

[MSG$00B073,11]
Snapping...

[MSG$00B08B,95]
I love it when the kneaded eraser's just about to snap after you stretch it out to the limit...

[MSG$00B0EF,85]
I get an adrenaline boost when I do this, and it stimulates my creative juices...NOT.

[MSG$00B151,11]
Kneading...

[MSG$00B169,13]
Stretching...

[MSG$00B183,11]
Snapping...

[MSG$00B1AF,4]
Pop!

[MSG$00B28E,14]
Minase "Ouch!"

[MSG$00B2B6,27]
Imari "What are you doing?"

[MSG$00B2EB,41]
Minase "I was just planning my strategy."

[MSG$00B32E,59]
Imari "Liar, What you mean is you're just procrastinating!"

[MSG$00B383,34]
Imari "Let's see what you've got."

[MSG$00B3BF,52]
So saying, Imari tries to sneak a look at my canvas.

[MSG$00B3F8,61]
I immediately try to shove it out of view, but it's too late.

[MSG$00B442,40]
Imari "Jeez, you haven't done anything!"

[MSG$00B484,66]
Imari "Man, I wish I knew how to make you pull your act together."

[MSG$00B4E0,65]
Imari says this as she peers at my canvas, sighing all the while.

[MSG$00B552,10]
Door opens

[MSG$00B569,32]
Imari "Oh...it's Ms. Takashiro."

[MSG$00B5D5,49]
The door opens, and our faculty advisor walks in.

[MSG$00B60B,89]
It's Hiroko Takashiro. She's an art instructor, and the faculty advisor for the Art Club,

[MSG$00B679,88]
Because of her good looks and also because she teaches art, she's very popular with both

[MSG$00B6D6,24]
|the boys and the girls.

[MSG$00B6FB,72]
Some of the students have chosen to concentrate on art because of her...

[MSG$00B748,74]
and the boys in the Art Club never miss a meeting. It's all thanks to her.

[MSG$00B797,20]
Being an art teacher

[MSG$00B7B0,55]
|some are of the flippant opinion that Art = Easy Pass.

[MSG$00B7F4,93]
Well, I'm not going to argue with that...I mean, since there's no written exam for this class

[MSG$00B856,28]
|why wouldn't it be popular?

[MSG$00B87F,37]
Takashiro "Is everyone working hard?"

[MSG$00B8BE,68]
Ms. Takashiro speaks to us as we concentrate on our respective work.

[MSG$00B907,48]
She's making the rounds, glancing at each easel.

[MSG$00B944,82]
Takashiro "Well! I see the vice president of the club is here today, How unusual!"

[MSG$00B9B0,43]
So she says as she approaches Imari and me.

[MSG$00BAAB,60]
Minase "You make me sound like a ghost member or something."

[MSG$00BB01,79]
Takashiro "If you know what I'm talking about, then you should be more diligent

[MSG$00BB55,19]
|about showing up."

[MSG$00BB82,20]
Minase "Yes, ma'am."

[MSG$00BBB0,56]
Takashiro "Hmm? But your canvas is still blank, Minase."

[MSG$00BC02,79]
As soon as she sees my canvas, she makes this remark. She sounds as exasperated

[MSG$00BC56,10]
|as Imari.

[MSG$00BC6D,78]
Takashiro "Really, now! I want you to make a serious effort, since we're going

[MSG$00BCC0,48]
|to be exhibiting these in the college art show.

[MSG$00BD0B,30]
That would disgrace the club!"

[MSG$00BD43,47]
Minase "In that case, let's not enter my work."

[MSG$00BD8C,76]
Takashiro "Oh, don't talk like that. See how hard our president is working!"

[MSG$00BDF2,41]
Ms. Takashiro taps Imari on the shoulder.

[MSG$00BE28,19]
Imari "Ha ha ha..."

[MSG$00BE55,34]
Imari smiles, looking embarrassed.

[MSG$00BE7C,75]
She's always known how to get ahead, this one. Always doing things right...

[MSG$00BECC,59]
And that's why I look like even more of a good-for-nothing.

[MSG$00BF14,51]
Takashiro "Why don't you have Ms. Imari teach you?"

[MSG$00BF61,59]
Takashiro "I know, you should have Ms. Imari model for you.

[MSG$00BFA1,43]
She's nearly finished with her own sketch."

[MSG$00BFE6,48]
What the heck is she thinking? Imari's no model!

[MSG$00C023,56]
Minase "Huh? Why do I have to sketch her of all people?"

[MSG$00C075,6]
Whack!

[MSG$00C088,24]
Imari "Well, excuse me!"

[MSG$00C0BA,101]
Takashiro "Oh? I happen to think Ms. Imari would make the ideal model. She definitely has potential."

[MSG$00C139,18]
Imari "Ehehehe..."

[MSG$00C165,37]
Minase "You've got to be kidding me."

[MSG$00C1A4,113]
Takashiro "And if I leave you with Ms. Imari as your model, you'll have no chance of slacking off, will you now?"

[MSG$00C22F,33]
That's got to be her real motive.

[MSG$00C25D,15]
Minase "But..."

[MSG$00C286,102]
Takashiro "There's no time for you to complain. If you don't hurry it up you won't make the deadline."

[MSG$00C306,15]
This is true...

[MSG$00C322,54]
Takashiro "All right, I'm counting on you, Ms. Imari."

[MSG$00C372,19]
Imari "Yes, ma'am!"

[MSG$00C39F,81]
What? Just like that, everything's all settled? And don't I have any say in this?

[MSG$00C3FD,92]
Takashiro "All right, then, I have something to take care of, so I'm leaving you in charge."

[MSG$00C497,75]
Takashiro leaves the room, and everyone goes back to their work in silence.

[MSG$00C521,63]
Imari "Do you know how lucky you are, having me as your model?"

[MSG$00C57A,21]
Minase "Yeah, right."

[MSG$00C5A9,31]
I sigh and take pity on myself.

[MSG$00C5CD,87]
I hadn't yet decided on a theme but I never thought I'd end up having to do a portrait.

[MSG$00C631,80]
It would've been so much easier to just do a still-life, or sketch some scenery.

[MSG$00C686,57]
Having to sketch Imari makes it ten thousand times worse.

[MSG$00C6CC,83]
Imari doesn't give a damn about my feelings. She brings over a chair and sits down.

[MSG$00C7B0,26]
Imari "Is this all right?"

[MSG$00C7E4,42]
Imari strikes a natural pose in the chair.

[MSG$00C81B,86]
I resign myself to the fact that one way or another I'm going to have to sketch Imari.

[MSG$00C87E,32]
Minase "Umm...yeah, I guess so."

[MSG$00C8B8,44]
I wave my pencil above my head dramatically.

[MSG$00C8E9,25]
For no reason, of course.

[MSG$00C90F,81]
Minase "I need you to strike some kind of pose, or this portrait will be boring."

[MSG$00C97A,82]
Imari "Yeah, but you have to think about the model, too! If I have to hold a pose,

[MSG$00C9D1,16]
I'll get tired."

[MSG$00C9FB,77]
Minase "Then just raise one of your knees. That won't tire you out, will it?"

[MSG$00CA62,25]
Imari "Okay...like this?"

[MSG$00CB1D,58]
Imari bends one of her knees and clasps it with her hands.

[MSG$00CB5C,55]
Not bad. Her skirt flips upward and it's pretty erotic.

[MSG$00CB98,16]
One more push...

[MSG$00CBD5,52]
Minase "Okay, can you open your legs a little more?"

[MSG$00CC23,43]
Imari "Huh? Is this...is this good enough?"

[MSG$00CC68,79]
Imari complies by opening her legs just a little. No more than an inch, really.

[MSG$00CCBC,44]
I won't even see her underwear at this rate.

[MSG$00CCF5,70]
Minase "No, that's not good enough. Wide open, now! Spread your legs!"

[MSG$00CDE4,4]
POW!

[MSG$00CE79,56]
As soon as the words were out of my mouth, Imari hit me.

[MSG$00CF59,42]
Imari "What are you trying to do, anyway?"

[MSG$00CF9D,79]
Minase "I was just kidding...why would I want to see your dirty undies anyway?"

[MSG$00D017,6]
SMACK!

[MSG$00D02A,39]
This time she slaps me across the face.

[MSG$00D05E,70]
Imari "They are not dirty! Just shut up and start drawing, you moron!"

[MSG$00D0C9,37]
Minase "Okay, take off your clothes."

[MSG$00D196,4]
POW!

[MSG$00D2C6,45]
Imari "Why do I have to take off my clothes?"

[MSG$00D30D,74]
Minase "Whaaat, you're not stripping? We gotta at least see your underwear

[MSG$00D35C,39]
|for you to make any impact, you know."

[MSG$00D39D,22]
Imari "Oh, drop dead!"

[MSG$00D3CD,47]
Minase "Oh, man, now I've lost all motivation."

[MSG$00D416,49]
Imari "Come on! Stop whining and get on with it!"

[MSG$00D461,37]
I reluctantly turn back to my canvas.

[MSG$00D50F,31]
Imari "Make me look good, now."

[MSG$00D548,61]
Minase "Don't count on it. It's not like the model's so hot."

[MSG$00D59F,13]
Imari "Grrr!"

[MSG$00D5C6,77]
Imari "Well, if you don't start taking this seriously, I'm gonna get pissed!"

[MSG$00D62D,20]
Minase "Yes, ma'am."

[MSG$00D65B,49]
I pick up my charcoal pencil and begin sketching.

[MSG$00D699,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00D6B2,10]
Staring...

[MSG$00D6C9,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00D6E2,10]
Erasing...

[MSG$00D6F9,10]
Staring...

[MSG$00D710,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00D729,29]
And...about one hour later...

[MSG$00D7CB,13]
Minase "...."

[MSG$00D7E5,39]
I look at my canvas and I'm speechless.

[MSG$00D819,22]
Oh, man...this is bad!

[MSG$00D83C,40]
This is SO going to get me into trouble!

[MSG$00D871,69]
Even I can hardly bear to look at it. I'm terrified of my own talent.

[MSG$00D93B,34]
Imari "So? How's it coming along?"

[MSG$00D977,57]
No good! If she sees this, I'll never hear the end of it.

[MSG$00D9BD,86]
Minase "Hey, don't look yet, If you see it now, you'll faint...that's how good it is!"

[MSG$00DA2E,58]
Imari "Really? You're only making me want to see it more."

[MSG$00DA82,49]
Minase "Hold on! Isn't it time to call it a day?"

[MSG$00DACD,55]
Imari "What? Omigod, I didn't realize how late it was!"

[MSG$00DB1E,46]
Checking her watch, she sees it's almost 5 PM.

[MSG$00DC00,59]
Imari "Sorry, I've got to get home, I have something to do.

[MSG$00DC40,61]
Can you lock up and bring this key back to the faculty room?"

[MSG$00DC97,83]
Imari clasps her hands together in a beseeching manner, and leaves me with the key.

[MSG$00DCF7,12]
Minase "ME?"

[MSG$00DD1D,72]
Imari "Come on, you're the vice president. It's the least you can do..."

[MSG$00DD7F,23]
Minase "Oh, all right."

[MSG$00DDB0,26]
I take the key from Imari.

[MSG$00DDCF,36]
Perfect! Boy, that was really close.

[MSG$00DE00,68]
Minase "Hey, too bad. I guess I'll let you see my sketch next time."

[MSG$00DE5E,61]
Imari "Huh? Oh, don't worry, I do have time to look it over."

[MSG$00DEB5,33]
Imari tries to peek at my sketch.

[MSG$00DEE3,51]
Minase "No way! We should save this for next time!"

[MSG$00DF30,54]
I quickly move the canvas out of her reach...and view.

[MSG$00DF73,17]
Imari "You sure?"

[MSG$00DF9F,22]
Minase "Shh! Go away."

[MSG$00DFE4,46]
Imari "Oh, well. Anyway, I'm counting on you!"

[MSG$00E050,59]
Imari quickly gathers up her stuff and leaves the Art Room.

[MSG$00E098,50]
Thank goodness I got out of showing her my sketch.

[MSG$00E0D7,67]
But I'm probably going to have to let her see it someday, anyway...

[MSG$00E11F,4]
Ugh.

[MSG$00E128,41]
I'll have to do something about it first.

[MSG$00E15E,35]
I think I'll see what I can do now.

[MSG$00E20B,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E224,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E23D,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E256,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E26F,79]
Now that the president has left, the others start to get ready to go home, too.

[MSG$00E2C3,108]
Left alone, I continue to struggle silently with this drawing of Imari that doesn't look a thing like her...

[MSG$00E33C,48]
Minase "Why am I stuck here doing this, anyway?"

[MSG$00E386,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E39F,10]
Erasing...

[MSG$00E3B6,12]

[MSG$00E42D,12]

[MSG$00E446,10]
Erasing...

[MSG$00E45D,12]
Sketching...

[MSG$00E476,16]
Minase "Sigh..."

[MSG$00E4A0,102]
I battle until it's almost time to leave school. I take a moment to check out my work from a distance.

[MSG$00E59C,14]
Minase "WHOA!"

[MSG$00E5C4,23]
Whoa, what the hell...?

[MSG$00E5E8,54]
The more I struggle, the worse I seem to be making it.

[MSG$00E623,70]
Such amazing talent. This is no mere sketch...it goes way beyond that.

[MSG$00E66E,41]
This is truly what you'd call cosmic art!

[MSG$00E6A4,45]
Minase "No good, I just don't have it today."

[MSG$00E767,50]
I suddenly look around and see that I'm all alone.

[MSG$00E7A6,31]
Minase "Sigh...I'm going home."

[MSG$00E7DF,68]
I'm sure I must be rusty, since I haven't drawn anything in so long.

[MSG$00E828,79]
I force myself to believe that, and stuff the canvas way back where no one will

[MSG$00E87C,18]
|will ever see it.

[MSG$00E89B,40]
Then I grab my stuff and leave the room.

[MSG$00E921,18]
April 20 - The Key

[MSG$00E9BA,87]
I make sure everything's locked up, and head toward the faculty room to return the key.

[MSG$00EA1E,100]
I look outside and see that there are some athletic clubs still out there, yelling as they practice.

[MSG$00EA8F,85]
I walk slowly towards the faculty room. There aren't many students left in the halls.

[MSG$00EAE9,68]
It feels strange to me, since I've never been the last one to leave.

[MSG$00EC07,14]
(Door opening)

[MSG$00EC22,52]
I open the door and enter the largely deserted room.

[MSG$00EC63,88]
It's almost totally empty, since at this hour most of the teachers are at club meetings,

[MSG$00ECC8,100]
The ones who are still there are sitting at their desks, smoking as they work on mid-term questions.

[MSG$00ED31,47]
None of the faculty advisors have returned yet.

[MSG$00ED6D,71]
I walk through the faculty room without a word, headed for the key box.

[MSG$00EDC1,83]
All of the school keys are kept in this box. They're removed on an as-needed basis.

[MSG$00EE19,75]
Imari's always in charge of the Art Room key, so I rarely return it myself.

[MSG$00EE71,5]
Click

[MSG$00EF0C,15]
I open the box.

[MSG$00EF28,39]
Inside, a number of keys hang on hooks.

[MSG$00EF5C,81]
I take the silver Art Room key from my pocket, and look for the hook I'm supposed

[MSG$00EFB2,15]
|to hang it on.

[MSG$00EFCE,45]
Minase "Let's see...where's the Art Room...?"

[MSG$00F015,40]
I look for a plate reading ''Art Room.''

[MSG$00F042,22]
I find it soon enough.

[MSG$00F065,20]
Minase "Here it is."

[MSG$00F093,8]
Click...

[MSG$00F0A8,77]
As I return the key and start to close the box, I happen to notice something,

[MSG$00F102,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00F129,49]
I stop, and take another look at the row of keys.

[MSG$00F167,73]
This key doesn't have a plate bearing the name of the room it belongs to,

[MSG$00F1BD,84]
I was never one to notice these things before, but for some reason, this time I did.

[MSG$00F216,66]
Unlike the other keys, this one is made of brass and shines dully.

[MSG$00F265,21]
I reach for this key,

[MSG$00F28F,64]
There's a plate on the key, and it tells me what the key is for.

[MSG$00F2D4,38]
And that's what grabbed my interest...

[MSG$00F307,83]
The wooden plate has some faint writing on it, which looks like it's about to fade.

[MSG$00F35F,44]
I squint at it, trying to read what it says.

[MSG$00F398,33]
Minase "Basement...storage room."

[MSG$00F3D3,35]
Those are the words I can make out.

[MSG$00F403,67]
Minase "Basement storage room? The key that opens the Secret Room?"

[MSG$00F4EB,24]
Basement storage room...

[MSG$00F510,42]
The room everyone calls the Secret Room...

[MSG$00F53F,43]
There's only one basement in this building.

[MSG$00F56F,77]
And there's definitely a plate on the door reading ''Basement Storage Room.''

[MSG$00F5C9,29]
The key to the Secret Room...

[MSG$00F5EB,55]
Right under my nose...I never dreamed I'd find it here.

[MSG$00F62F,42]
If I use this key, I can open that door...

[MSG$00F65E,53]
That means that I can find out if that rumor is true.

[MSG$00F6A0,62]
Not that I expect to find anything that surprising down there.

[MSG$00F6E3,45]
But I do want to know why it's always locked.

[MSG$00F71D,66]
It might be a coincidence, or there might be some hidden secret...

[MSG$00F76C,59]
The rumor might have developed just because no one has ever

[MSG$00F7AC,22]
|seen what was inside.

[MSG$00F7C7,64]
But if I used this key, I could become the witness to the truth.

[MSG$00F814,58]
This is a great opportunity to lay the old legend to rest.

[MSG$00F85B,60]
Nothing wrong with setting things straight with my own eyes.

[MSG$00F8AF,58]
Making sure no one sees me, I remove the key from its hook

[MSG$00F8EE,29]
|and stuff it into my pocket.

[MSG$00F910,28]
None of the teachers see me.

[MSG$00F939,58]
As long as I return it when I'm done, what does it matter?

[MSG$00F978,67]
They're strict about the keys, but since no one ever uses this one,

[MSG$00F9C0,60]
I'm sure no one will notice it's gone, if I don't take long.

[MSG$00FA01,57]
And it's not as if someone needs to use this key, anyway.

[MSG$00FA53,71]
I close the key box, and leave the faculty room as if nothing happened.

[MSG$00FAF8,26]
April 20 - Basement Stairs

[MSG$00FB99,76]
As soon as I'm out the door, I stick my hand in my pocket and touch the key,

[MSG$00FBEA,42]
I feel the cold brass against my finger...

[MSG$00FC21,88]
If Ito and Saeki were around, I'd let them come along to witness me open the door to the

[MSG$00FC7E,85]
|Secret Room, but since they always leave school on the double, there's no way they'd

[MSG$00FCD8,28]
|still be here at this hour.

[MSG$00FD01,89]
Oh, well, I can always ask them later. All I have to do is remember where the key's kept,

[MSG$00FD5F,39]
and it won't be any problem to snag it.

[MSG$00FD8B,74]
And it'll probably be better to show them after I've seen it myself first.

[MSG$00FDE2,92]
I plan to tell them all about it in a calm, measured tone of voice, all the while basking in

[MSG$00FE43,50]
|superiority as someone who's already been inside.

[MSG$00FE7A,47]
I can already see the jealousy in their eyes...

[MSG$00FEB6,65]
Feeling smug, I remove the key to the Secret Room from my pocket,

[MSG$00FEFC,70]
let it jingle in the air, and head downstairs towards the first floor.

[MSG$00FFCC,50]
I reach the first floor and head for my objective.

[MSG$01000B,18]
The Secret Door...

[MSG$010022,36]
It just looks like an ordinary door.

[MSG$01004B,64]
It's there, right at the bottom of the stairs, in a lonely spot.

[MSG$010090,120]
There's nothing special about this door...The sign says, ''Basement Storage Room.'' It just looks like an ordinary door.

[MSG$010115,92]
There's only one thing that catches the eye...the sign proclaiming that it's ''OFF LIMITS.''

[MSG$010176,56]
That's the only reason why they call it the Secret Room.

[MSG$0101BB,74]
Beyond this door are the stairs leading down to the Basement Storage Room.

[MSG$01020A,86]
It's the door downstairs that's locked, so it shouldn't be a problem to open this one,

[MSG$01026D,83]
I stare at the door for a moment, then reach out and grip the cold knob in my hand.

[MSG$0102CD,46]
Girl "You can't go in there, it's off-limits."

[MSG$010315,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$0103DB,55]
I'm shaken by the voice that suddenly called out to me.

[MSG$010417,71]
I take my hand off the doorknob and look in the direction of the voice.

[MSG$01046B,34]
A female student is staring at me.

[MSG$01049A,40]
It's a girl from my class, Rika Shiraki.

[MSG$0104C7,98]
She's good-looking, always gets top grades, and to top it all off, she's also the President of the

[MSG$01052E,17]
|Student Council.

[MSG$01054C,72]
Shiraki "It's no use going down there, since the door is locked anyway."

[MSG$0105AE,103]
I'm stunned. She gives me a scornful glance but her voice is rather considerate as she walks toward me.

[MSG$01061A,30]
Of course I already know that.

[MSG$010645,22]
Minase "Yeah, I know."

[MSG$010675,61]
I try to look calm. I answer her as nonchalantly as possible.

[MSG$0106B7,80]
She may be an uninvited guest, but I can't just blow off this Rika Shiraki girl.

[MSG$010714,87]
Rika Shiraki...I know her by sight, but this is the first time I've ever spoken to her.

[MSG$010770,29]
Needless to say, it's mutual.

[MSG$01079A,63]
Actually, there's a good chance that she didn't know me at all.

[MSG$0107DE,75]
I mean, she went out of her way to reprimand me. Oh, well. What can you do?

[MSG$01082E,47]
I'm not the type of guy who stands out, anyway.

[MSG$01086A,33]
I start staring at Shiraki again.

[MSG$010890,71]
What a princess...those good looks of hers and her perfect personality.

[MSG$0108DC,59]
No wonder everyone adores her, both the guys and the girls.

[MSG$010924,56]
And so different than Imari! That thought made me smile.

[MSG$010961,77]
If I had to compare them, I'd say Shiraki was a purebred dog with a pedigree,

[MSG$0109B3,53]
whereas Imari was like a mutt fathered by some stray.

[MSG$0109F5,86]
No, that might be way too harsh. If Imari found out, I wouldn't live to tell the tale.

[MSG$010A58,47]
Shiraki "But why do you want to go down there?"

[MSG$010AA1,46]
Shiraki's huge eyes widen as she asks me this.

[MSG$010ADC,33]
Minase "To find out the truth..."

[MSG$010B17,27]
Shiraki blinks at my words.

[MSG$010B3F,26]
Shiraki "You're so funny."

[MSG$010B73,80]
I smile along with Shiraki. No way do I believe that Shiraki swallowed my story.

[MSG$010BC8,64]
I'm sure she just thought I was joking. Well, that works for me.

[MSG$010C15,67]
Minase "Do you believe that rumor about the basement storage room?"

[MSG$010C72,80]
I ask her casually. I really want to know what this girl thinks about the rumor.

[MSG$010CCF,15]
Shiraki "What?"

[MSG$010CF8,52]
She tilts her head at this sudden, idiotic question.

[MSG$010D31,54]
I was trying to be casual, but maybe I was too abrupt?

[MSG$010D74,62]
But after thinking it over, she answered me in a serious tone.

[MSG$010DBF,36]
Shiraki "Well, I'm not really sure."

[MSG$010DFD,97]
Shiraki "I don't think I've ever thought about it. Anyway, I think rumors are interesting because

[MSG$010E63,51]
|they're rumors...that goes for any kind of rumor."

[MSG$010EB0,99]
Shiraki "I think it's more fun to go on believing, rather than being disappointed when you find out

[MSG$010F18,40]
|the truth, Just like with Santa Claus."

[MSG$010F5A,29]
Minase "You really think so?"

[MSG$010F91,58]
What a romantic point of view, I could never emulate that.

[MSG$010FD0,48]
I prefer everything to be either black or white.

[MSG$01100D,46]
Minase "Very interesting, I'll remember that."

[MSG$011055,58]
Shiraki "When you discover the truth, please let me know."

[MSG$01111E,51]
She smiles as she says this, and slowly walks away.

[MSG$01115E,26]
Is the door really locked?

[MSG$01117D,41]
But the key to that door is in my pocket.

[MSG$0111AB,46]
I'm sure she never dreamed that I had the key,

[MSG$0111DE,77]
That's how great the legend of this basement taboo was to all of us students.

[MSG$011238,86]
The key to the secret garden, huh? How did that story by Gaskell go--someone found the

[MSG$011293,44]
|key to what was supposedly a locked garden,

[MSG$0112C4,64]
|and when it was opened, there was nothing but a ravaged lawn...

[MSG$011311,74]
It's just like Shiraki said. Gossip and truth are rarely one and the same.

[MSG$011368,26]
Minase "All right then..."

[MSG$01139C,10]
Door opens

[MSG$0113B3,80]
Once again, I make sure no one's around. Then I turn the knob and open the door.

[MSG$011408,28]
The door swings open easily.

[MSG$0114B5,111]
It's dark inside. The stairs leading down to the basement storage room are dimly lit by the light from outside.

[MSG$011531,21]
Minase "It's dark..."

[MSG$011560,67]
In this darkness, the stairs are like an even darker, ominous hole.

[MSG$0115A8,66]
And within this hole is a steep staircase leading to the basement.

[MSG$0115F7,46]
Beyond those eerie stairs lie the Secret Room.

[MSG$011632,45]
It's cold in here. You'd think the AC was on.

[MSG$01166C,61]
It's the perfect atmosphere for a creepy rumor like this one.

[MSG$0116AE,80]
Such a mysterious atmosphere...it's the perfect place to do something in secret.

[MSG$011755,41]
I look for a light switch for the stairs.

[MSG$01178B,53]
There's some kind of switch at the top of the stairs.

[MSG$0117C5,13]
I flip it on.

[MSG$0117DF,8]
Click...

[MSG$01186C,58]
Instantly, a dim white light bulb goes on in the darkness.

[MSG$0118B3,86]
The light is extremely weak. It would be an overstatement to call it ''light'' at all.

[MSG$01190E,96]
Even if this place is never used, the least they could do would be to put in fluorescent lights.

[MSG$01197B,41]
Well, I guess it's better than nothing...

[MSG$0119F8,34]
It's too dark as it is to go down.

[MSG$011A1F,33]
I can't even see where I'm going.

[MSG$011A4D,30]
I've got to turn on the light.

[MSG$011A70,46]
I know there's a switch around here somewhere.

[MSG$011AB6,80]
Keeping my hands against the wall, I slowly make my way down the dark staircase.

[MSG$011B13,66]
The stairs are made of concrete. They're plain and dreary-looking.

[MSG$011B62,103]
I can hear the eerie sound of my own footsteps going down the stairs in that closed-off, cramped space.

[MSG$011BCE,70]
I gingerly go down the stairs, nearly losing my balance several times.

[MSG$011C21,22]
Thump, thump, thump...

[MSG$011CC0,100]
I've gone down 10-plus steps when my feet hit some level ground. Looks like I've made it to the end,

[MSG$011D31,64]
In front of me is a heavy steel door, seemingly blocking my way.

[MSG$011D7E,38]
Minase "So this is the Secret Room..."

[MSG$011DBE,27]
The name seems appropriate.

[MSG$011DE6,39]
It's a plain, old-fashioned steel door.

[MSG$011E12,64]
There's a metal plate; all it says is ''Basement Storage Room.''

[MSG$011E5F,46]
They could've at least painted it pink or red.

[MSG$011E92,34]
But no, that would be creepy, too.

[MSG$011EC1,111]
This isn't the first time I've come down here. But this is the first time I've gotten a good look at this door.

[MSG$011F3D,87]
There's some graffiti on the door as well. It could be the work of some cruel students,

[MSG$011F99,55]
but someone has scribbled cryptic symbols and diagrams.

[MSG$011FD5,45]
They make it all seem even creepier, somehow.

[MSG$01200F,73]
I trace one of the letters, written in fluid handwriting, with my finger.

[MSG$01205D,60]
But I can't read it, since it doesn't seem to be in English.

[MSG$0120A6,94]
Same thing with the diagrams over and around the door. I have no idea what they meant, either.

[MSG$012109,59]
But it was too unnatural-looking and creepy to be graffiti.

[MSG$012151,66]
Minase "Well, it sure doesn't look like just some storage room..."

[MSG$0121AD,104]
I shiver as I say this. It's a lot colder down here than upstairs, probably because there's no sunlight.

[MSG$01221A,83]
In this temperature, it's sure not comfortable to be clad only in a school uniform.

[MSG$01227A,57]
Minase "I'll just take a quick look and get out of here."

[MSG$0122CD,32]
I take the key out of my pocket.

[MSG$0122FA,56]
Then I slip the key into the keyhole under the doorknob.

[MSG$012337,49]
The key slides into the hole; it's a perfect fit.

[MSG$012375,50]
Minase "Okay, time for a tour of the Secret Room."

[MSG$0123C1,47]
I grip the key and twist it to the right, hard.

[MSG$0123FD,8]
Clink...

[MSG$012412,45]
I can feel and hear the tumblers unlocking...

[MSG$012444,61]
Now there's nothing that will stop me from opening this door.

[MSG$01248E,61]
From this moment, the Secret Room will no longer be secret...

[MSG$0124D0,115]
I grasp the cold steel doorknob...slowly and carefully, I turn it to the right...and I swing the heavy door open...

[MSG$012550,9]
Squeak...

[MSG$012566,77]
I hear the grating sound of metal against metal. Then the door swings inward.

[MSG$0125C0,53]
I stop it when it's about 30cm open, and peer inside.

[MSG$0125FA,77]
Not that I believe that rumor, but I have no idea what I might find in there.

[MSG$01264C,43]
Being alone, I'm just a little bit nervous.

[MSG$012684,82]
What I can see through the narrow opening is a vast dark space, as black as ink...

[MSG$0126E3,82]
I can feel how cold the air is inside...it smells like a mixture of dust and mold.

[MSG$01273A,49]
It almost has a horrible graveyard smell to it...

[MSG$012778,73]
But I can't see anything inside the room itself, because of the darkness.

[MSG$0127CE,29]
I pushed the door open wider.

[MSG$0127F8,9]
Squeak...

[MSG$01280E,19]
April 20 - Basement

[MSG$012977,29]
Minase "Gag...gag...choke..."

[MSG$0129AE,74]
As soon as I open the door, I nearly choke on the dusty air from the room.

[MSG$0129FD,87]
All this dust could be proof that this room really hasn't been opened in over 10 years.

[MSG$012A61,67]
I flail my arms around me, trying to shake the dust off my clothes.

[MSG$012AB1,56]
Once I've done that, I take a good look around the room.

[MSG$012AF6,65]
But even with the door opened wide, it's too dark to see a thing,

[MSG$012B3C,58]
since there are no windows to let any light into the room.

[MSG$012B7B,86]
The light from the staircase is too weak, and it doesn't even reach this room, anyway.

[MSG$012BDE,42]
There's no way I can see inside this room.

[MSG$012C15,86]
I take a step inside the dark room, and start groping for a light switch on the walls.

[MSG$012C70,45]
There's got to be at least one light in here.

[MSG$012CAA,55]
I can feel the rough texture of concrete under my hand.

[MSG$012CEE,46]
After about 10 seconds, I feel something hard.

[MSG$012D29,20]
Minase "Is this it?"

[MSG$012D57,94]
I grasp what I think is a light switch with my fingers, and flip it in the opposite direction.

[MSG$012DC2,50]
There's a snapping sound, and the power goes on...

[MSG$012E01,19]
But, wait a minute.

[MSG$012E21,13]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$012E48,74]
The light should've gone on, but the room is still just as dark as before.

[MSG$012E97,40]
It doesn't work out, and I'm in despair.

[MSG$012ECC,22]
Click, click, click...

[MSG$012EEF,85]
I try flipping the switch on and off, over and over, but always with the same result.

[MSG$012F49,43]
Was I turning on something else altogether?

[MSG$012F81,77]
I start to look for another switch somewhere, running my hand along the wall.

[MSG$012FD3,54]
But I can't find anything that might be such a switch.

[MSG$013016,19]
Minase "No good..."

[MSG$013043,43]
Maybe the breakers weren't working anymore.

[MSG$013073,98]
Since the room hadn't been used in so long, it would make sense if they'd cut off the electricity.

[MSG$0130E2,69]
But I couldn't do anything about it, since the switch box was locked.

[MSG$013134,94]
Maybe I should come back after finding something I could light my way with. But I didn't think

[MSG$013197,41]
|I'd find anything useful here at school.

[MSG$0131CD,95]
I try to remember if I'd ever seen a flashlight lying around somewhere at school, but couldn't.

[MSG$013231,58]
If worst came to worst, I'd have to bring one from home...

[MSG$013278,91]
I'm at my wits' end. I stare into the darkness before me. After managing to open this door,

[MSG$0132D8,74]
I can't believe I'm going to go home empty-handed because of the darkness.

[MSG$01332F,104]
After a while, my eyes get used to the darkness, and I'm able to make out the faint outline of the room.

[MSG$0133A4,71]
But the room is empty, and it doesn't look like there's anything in it.

[MSG$0133F0,68]
It's too empty for a room that had once been used as a storage room.

[MSG$013441,77]
Kicking myself for not coming prepared, I take a few steps into the darkness.

[MSG$013493,78]
I can't see a thing, but I couldn't stand the thought of leaving empty-handed.

[MSG$0134EE,108]
I can feel the dust swirling with every step I take. I frantically brush away all the cobwebs that cover me.

[MSG$013567,5]
Thump

[MSG$013579,71]
I haven't gone far before I feel my foot strike something on the floor.

[MSG$0135CD,68]
I stop, and look down at my feet, not expecting to be able to see...

[MSG$013616,33]
Of course, I can't see a thing...

[MSG$013664,73]
Bracing myself, I reach down and grab whatever it is that's on the floor.

[MSG$0136BA,8]
Crash...

[MSG$0136CF,111]
It's something solid and heavy, and suddenly something falls.. The sound of steel reverberates around the room.

[MSG$01374B,13]
Did it break?

[MSG$013765,43]
I've lost the tip of the object in my hand.

[MSG$013795,32]
I run my hands over what's left.

[MSG$0137C2,25]
Minase "It's a candle..."

[MSG$0137F5,54]
From its shape and feel, I'm sure it's a large candle.

[MSG$013830,23]
It's still a good size.

[MSG$013854,60]
So whatever had been on the tip was probably a candleholder.

[MSG$01389D,101]
I lucked out this time. Now if I can just find a light, I'll be able to use this to explore the room.

[MSG$01391A,22]
Minase "What is this?"

[MSG$01394A,58]
I try to figure out what it is by running my foot over it.

[MSG$013989,85]
It's something hard, and every time it rolls over the floor there's a clicking sound.

[MSG$0139EB,59]
I take my foot off, and reach down on the floor to feel it.

[MSG$013A33,39]
It's a long, thin. stick-shaped object.

[MSG$013A5F,34]
It feels cold. It's made of steel.

[MSG$013A86,29]
I run my hands all around it.

[MSG$013AB0,31]
Minase "It's a candleholder..."

[MSG$013AE9,31]
It was a holder for the candle.

[MSG$013B15,75]
The tip is split into 3, and there's a good-sized candle still stuck in it.

[MSG$013B6D,101]
I lucked out this time. Now if I can just find a light, I'll be able to use this to explore the room.

[MSG$013BDF,55]
Minase "I'm pretty sure there's a lighter in my bag..."

[MSG$013C30,57]
I thrust my hand inside my bag, and find a cheap lighter.

[MSG$013C6E,62]
Then I wipe the dust off the candle, and flick on the lighter.

[MSG$013CB9,5]
Flick

[MSG$013CCB,5]
Flick

[MSG$013CDD,5]
Flick

[MSG$013CEF,11]
(lights up)

[MSG$013E56,59]
I hold the lighter close to the candle, and light the wick.

[MSG$013E96,96]
It took a while, probably because it hadn't been used in so long, but I kept at it until finally

[MSG$013EFB,47]
|the wax began to melt, and the candle was lit.

[MSG$013F37,60]
The flame was weak at first, but gradually it grew stronger.

[MSG$013F80,80]
I waited until I was sure it wouldn't go out, then held it up to light the room.

[MSG$013FDD,116]
The light from a single candle wasn't really enough to light the whole e room, but it was still better than nothing.

[MSG$01405E,61]
Finally, the light from the candle drove away the darkness...

[MSG$0140A0,53]
And gradually I was able to see the rest of the room.

[MSG$0140DA,27]
Sealed away 12 years ago...

[MSG$0140FA,58]
The truth I had been looking for was now before my eyes...

[MSG$0141B9,38]
Minase "What...what the hell is this?"

[MSG$0141F9,40]
I was speechless at the sight before me.

[MSG$01422E,23]
Such a bizarre scene...

[MSG$01424A,102]
The amber light from the candle revealed a scene that was straight out of a low-budget occult movie...

[MSG$0142BD,62]
And it was sight far more terrible than any rumor I'd heard...

[MSG$014308,36]
A room measuring 10m on each side...

[MSG$014331,67]
An eerie room that could only be a ''storage room'' in name only...

[MSG$014379,29]
The vestiges of a ceremony...

[MSG$01439B,62]
Undoubtedly, the vestiges of the ceremony held 12 years ago...

[MSG$0143E6,25]
Left completely intact...

[MSG$01440C,38]
Minase "What kind of a joke is this?!"

[MSG$01444C,40]
It was too elaborate to be a mere prank.

[MSG$014481,119]
Candle in hand, I stumble around the room. The thick dust that had collected on the floor is disturbed by my footsteps.

[MSG$0144FD,116]
Underneath the dust, I can see mysterious diagrams and words written in white paint or something on the black floor,

[MSG$01457E,16]
A huge circle...

[MSG$014593,66]
And a cross, which seemed to be dividing the circle in sections...

[MSG$0145DA,48]
Cryptic words scattered all over this diagram...

[MSG$014617,73]
And next to the circle, there's another diagram: a triangle and a circle.

[MSG$01466D,42]
Could this be what they called a talisman?

[MSG$0146A4,56]
There were numerous candles surrounding this talisman...

[MSG$0146E9,62]
At the end of the room I can see that an altar has been built.

[MSG$014734,80]
A closer look shows me that it's a simple altar, just a sofa covered in a cloth.

[MSG$014789,64]
Around the altar, incense and metal urns are scattered untidily.

[MSG$0147D6,84]
But what makes this room really creepy is the eerie stains on the walls and ceiling.

[MSG$014837,52]
These stains decorate the room almost geometrically.

[MSG$014870,88]
I couldn't see any on the black floor, but I'm sure it's just that they don't stand out.

[MSG$0148D5,71]
I walk carefully through the room, trying not to tread on the talisman.

[MSG$014929,48]
Without thinking, I pick up the cup on the desk.

[MSG$01495E,115]
Inside I can see some kind of liquid that's solidified and turned black. As soon as I see this, I put the cup down.

[MSG$0149DE,109]
As I explore the room, I find other things on the floor among the candlesticks, like a long saber and knives.

[MSG$014A50,42]
Did they use these things in the ceremony?

[MSG$014A87,57]
I can't even imagine what could have happened that day...

[MSG$014AC5,45]
No, I'm too scared to even try to imagine it.

[MSG$014AFF,74]
Minase "So the rumor about what happened 12 years ago...it was true, huh?"

[MSG$014B63,15]
I am terrified.

[MSG$014B77,97]
The scene before my eyes...there's no question that it speaks of what happened here 12 years ago.

[MSG$014BE5,86]
Just like the rumor...no, it's so realistic it tosses that rumor right out the window.

[MSG$014C40,95]
The room anyone would imagine after hearing that rumor...here it was, recreated before my eyes.

[MSG$014CAC,32]
This was some kind of sick joke.

[MSG$014CD9,82]
That's what I wanted to think, but it was too late to just brush it off like that.

[MSG$014D30,69]
Nobody could be stupid enough to go to these lengths just for a joke.

[MSG$014D82,23]
I had seen it myself...

[MSG$014D9E,83]
My intent was to prove that it was just a rumor. But I ended up discovering that it

[MSG$014DF6,29]
|was true...with my own eyes.

[MSG$014E20,55]
The eerie room and the chill in the air made me shiver.

[MSG$014E5C,72]
So I found a spot on the wall that had no stains, and leaned against it.

[MSG$014EB1,25]
Minase "What the hell..."

[MSG$014EE4,44]
Minase "I can't believe the rumor was true."

[MSG$014F2A,102]
I don't know how much of this was true. But at the very least, there really was a Black Magic Society,

[MSG$014F95,76]
and they performed some kind of ceremony here...that much seemed undeniable.

[MSG$014FEE,31]
And what exactly happened here?

[MSG$015012,87]
One thing I'm sure of is that the girls weren't killed by the Devil, as Saeki has said.

[MSG$015076,62]
I tell myself that as I look closer at the stains on the wall.

[MSG$0150C1,31]
Minase "There's just no way..."

[MSG$0150FA,29]
Suddenly I'm extremely tired.

[MSG$015124,95]
I never dreamed that a room just like the one described in that rumor would be behind the door.

[MSG$015188,88]
Even though I've just seen something totally mind-blowing, I don't want to believe that.

[MSG$0151ED,67]
I can't very well tell Saeki now that the rumor was true after all.

[MSG$01523D,71]
No, now that I've seen this, I don't even want to tell anyone about it.

[MSG$015291,54]
Now I understand why the teachers won't talk about it.

[MSG$0152CC,47]
This room is nothing to brag about to students.

[MSG$015308,86]
I wonder if the teachers who found this room locked it up because they were afraid the

[MSG$015363,41]
|students might start gossiping about it.

[MSG$015391,55]
And so they turned away from it, for years and years...

[MSG$0153D5,59]
But no, that's still no reason to keep it locked like that.

[MSG$015415,77]
If it was an eyesore, then they wouldn't have left everything the way it was.

[MSG$01546F,31]
Why would they choose to do so?

[MSG$01549B,38]
What the hell went on in here, anyway?

[MSG$0154CE,16]
Minase "Sigh..."

[MSG$0154F8,16]
I sighed deeply.

[MSG$015515,65]
If this was what was in store for me, I wish I'd never found out.

[MSG$01555B,79]
I thought I'd feel relieved to know the truth, but this was the total opposite.

[MSG$0155B7,46]
I remembered what Rika Shiraki had said to me.

[MSG$0155ED,92]
''I think rumors are interesting because they're rumors...that goes for any kind of rumor.''

[MSG$015656,20]
Minase "A rumor...?"

[MSG$015684,60]
Trying to move away from the wall, I put my hand against it.

[MSG$0156C5,107]
I wanted to leave this cursed room as soon as possible, If I stayed here any longer, I would surely go mad.

[MSG$01573D,14]
Minase "Whoa."

[MSG$015765,10]
Slither...

[MSG$01577C,61]
As I stand, I brace my hand, the one I have against the wall.

[MSG$0157BE,62]
At that moment my right hand suddenly sinks into the concrete.

[MSG$015809,10]
Slither...

[MSG$015820,14]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$015848,42]
I lose balance and nearly land on my butt.

[MSG$01587F,23]
Minase "Hey, now what?"

[MSG$01592C,33]
I take a closer look at the wall.

[MSG$01595A,111]
I see that the concrete block I touched with my hand has unnaturally sunken an inch or so more than the others.

[MSG$0159CE,48]
Structural defect? Or was it just deterioration?

[MSG$015A0B,36]
Curious, I push the block some more.

[MSG$015A3C,10]
Slither...

[MSG$015ACC,23]
The block sinks deeper.

[MSG$015AE8,21]
Was it hollow inside?

[MSG$015B0A,62]
I find this bizarre, and manage to push the block to the side.

[MSG$015B55,7]
Thud...

[MSG$015BF2,38]
There's a tiny space behind the block.

[MSG$015C25,37]
But why would there be a hollow here?

[MSG$015C4F,39]
No question, it was intentionally made.

[MSG$015C83,35]
I shine the candle into the hollow.

[MSG$015CAB,39]
Now that the space is lit by my candle,

[MSG$015CD7,93]
I can see something that looks like a small square box wrapped in a white cloth or something.

[MSG$015D41,31]
Minase "What the hell is this?"

[MSG$015D7A,81]
The cloth is coiled around whatever it is...it almost looks like a big lunch box.

[MSG$015DD0,26]
What the hell could it be?

[MSG$015DF7,97]
If someone hid it in a place like this, it's got to be something they didn't want anyone to find.

[MSG$015EC4,68]
I reach for it, remove it from the hollow and hold it in both hands.

[MSG$015F0D,18]
It's pretty heavy.

[MSG$015F2C,50]
It's about 25cm lengthwise, and about 35cm high...

[MSG$015F63,32]
It's probably about 4cm thick...

[MSG$015F90,41]
I shake it, and there's a rustling sound.

[MSG$015FBE,21]
What could be inside?

[MSG$015FE0,45]
I can't really tell with the cloth over it...

[MSG$01607B,37]
Cautiously, I remove the white cloth.

[MSG$0160AD,45]
Something totally unexpected could be inside.

[MSG$0160DF,70]
If it's been hidden in this room, there's no telling what it might be,

[MSG$016132,90]
It might be wrapped around a few times...it takes a while for me to be able to see inside.

[MSG$016191,103]
Finally I'm able to catch a glimpse. Inside the white cloth, I can see something made of black leather.

[MSG$016205,31]
I unwrap the cloth some more...

[MSG$016229,50]
And at last the white cloth is removed completely.

[MSG$01629C,17]
Minase "A book?!"

[MSG$0162C7,70]
A book with sturdy leather trimmings has emerged from the white cloth.

[MSG$01631A,38]
It's a huge book, with B5-sized pages.

[MSG$016345,57]
There's some kind of white diagram on the blackish cover.

[MSG$016383,42]
A sword thrust upside-down in a hexagon...

[MSG$0163BA,93]
And there's a metal chain wrapped around the top of the book, It seems to be holding it shut.

[MSG$01641C,104]
This is a bizarre, even tacky-looking book. Definitely not something you'd find in your local bookstore.

[MSG$016491,73]
It must be really old. The leather cover is all moldy and worn in places.

[MSG$0164E7,51]
I want to look inside, so I unhook the metal chain.

[MSG$01651F,27]
And I slowly open the book.

[MSG$0165C4,14]
(Page turning)

[MSG$0165DF,67]
As I turn the thick cover, I see a strange drawing on the fly leaf.

[MSG$01662F,87]
It's drawn in black ink, and it looks even creepier in the amber light from the candle.

[MSG$016693,14]
(Page turning)

[MSG$0166AE,104]
I turn another page, and find a burned, discolored page covered all over with strange handwritten words.

[MSG$016723,22]
I turn another page...

[MSG$016746,111]
The writing seems to go on and on about something, interrupted only by the occasional weird drawing or diagram.

[MSG$0167BA,39]
Of course there's no way I can read it.

[MSG$0167EE,64]
I keep skimming through, going over each page like an automaton.

[MSG$01683B,60]
When I've skimmed through the whole thing, I close the book.

[MSG$016901,16]
Minase "Sigh..."

[MSG$01692B,71]
I glanced through the whole book, but I couldn't read any of it at all.

[MSG$01697F,70]
All I was able to grasp was that it was probably a book about magic...

[MSG$0169CA,79]
There are numerous drawings of geometric shapes...talismans drawn on the floor.

[MSG$016A26,71]
Most likely, this book was read by the people who had used this room...

[MSG$016A72,96]
And it was probably from this book that they learned about the ceremonies they carried out here.

[MSG$016ADF,93]
I could see why someone would want to believe in this book...I had no idea where they got it,

[MSG$016B41,90]
|but it sure looked a lot more convincing than any dubious book you'd find in a bookstore.

[MSG$016BA8,63]
I'd really like to know what it says, but I'm totally clueless.

[MSG$016BEC,69]
If it were at least written in Japanese I'd be able to get an idea...

[MSG$016C3E,82]
Anyhow, it definitely seems worth it to bring it home and try to make sense of it.

[MSG$016C95,67]
I'm not really sure I'll be able to read it, but at the very least,

[MSG$016CDD,71]
the ones who used this room were able to. I'll never know unless I try.

[MSG$016D31,100]
Not that I have any interest in magic or anything. But I am curious about what it says in this book.

[MSG$016DA2,94]
Something so gripping it caused those students from 12 years ago to become totally obsessed...

[MSG$016E05,38]
I was sure that was what it contained.

[MSG$016E38,107]
Not only that, but it had been kept carefully hidden all this time. Surely it had to be really important...

[MSG$016EB0,96]
And one more thing...this book just might contain clues as to what went on in here 12 years ago.

[MSG$016F99,72]
I re-wrapped the book the way I'd found it, then stuffed it into my bag.

[MSG$016FE6,84]
Thanks to the book, my bag (usually wafer-thin) looks like it's going to burst open.

[MSG$017047,65]
Then I put the block back in place, covering up the hollow space.

[MSG$017095,5]
Thump

[MSG$0170A7,17]
Minase "All set."

[MSG$0170D2,50]
I picked up my bag, now heavy because of the book.

[MSG$017109,46]
Then I blew out the candle, and left the room.

[MSG$017144,10]
Screech...

[MSG$01715B,4]
Slam

[MSG$0171EA,103]
I shut the steel door and lock it. If I had a choice, I'd never want to go into a room like that again.

[MSG$017256,90]
Still, as soon as I closed the door, I somehow sensed that I would be returning one day...

[MSG$01733A,59]
I make sure the door's locked, then race toward the stairs.

[MSG$01737A,47]
I go up the stairs, and steal into the hallway.

[MSG$0173B6,12]
Door closing

[MSG$017453,79]
I shut the door, and start walking down the hallway as if nothing had happened.

[MSG$0174A7,56]
Luckily, no one was there to notice what I'd been up to.

[MSG$0174EC,90]
I'm pretty sure no one would believe that something so bizarre was hidden in the basement.

[MSG$017553,50]
Something like that had to be seen to be believed.

[MSG$01758A,31]
A rumor is nothing but a rumor.

[MSG$0175AE,89]
People can ridicule the gossip they exchange because no one has actually seen the source.

[MSG$017614,68]
And that's because deep down inside they know that it can't be real.

[MSG$01765D,113]
...It's possible that whoever started the rumor actually did somehow happen to see that bizarre scene downstairs.

[MSG$0176DB,64]
Anyway, it would probably be best not to tell anyone what I saw.

[MSG$017720,109]
It kind of sucks that I can't tell Ito and Saeki about it, but at this point the news would only please them.

[MSG$017792,35]
It would be wiser not to tell them.

[MSG$0177C2,49]
I head toward the Faculty Room to return the key,

[MSG$0177F8,77]
I look at the clock and see that it's almost 6 PM. I'd better head home soon.

[MSG$0178A3,40]
April 20 - Hall in front of Faculty Room

[MSG$01796C,55]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. So you're still here?"

[MSG$0179BD,71]
Just as I'm about to enter the Faculty Room, Takashiro calls out to me.

[MSG$017A09,32]
Damn. Could her timing be worse?

[MSG$017A36,38]
Minase "Yes, I'm just about to leave."

[MSG$017A76,66]
As I reply, I stick my hand in the pocket where I stashed the key.

[MSG$017ABD,59]
There would be trouble if she found out I'd taken that key.

[MSG$017AFD,73]
After all, that basement storage room is taboo among the faculty as well.

[MSG$017B53,104]
Takashiro "But you know, when I went to the Art Room, it had already been locked. That was a while ago."

[MSG$017BD5,27]
She is obviously mystified.

[MSG$017BF5,14]
This is bad...

[MSG$017C10,66]
Minase "Well, I forgot to return the key. That's why I came back."

[MSG$017C6C,69]
I tried to get out of it with the first lie that popped into my head.

[MSG$017CBE,55]
Takashiro "Oh, in that case, I'll put it away for you."

[MSG$017D0F,29]
This isn't getting out of it!

[MSG$017D31,88]
This is really bad. If she opens the box, she'll see that Art Room key is already there.

[MSG$017D96,99]
Minase "Oh, that's all right. As Vice President, I take full responsibility for returning the key."

[MSG$017E13,59]
Takashiro "Oh, are you sure? Then I'll leave it up to you."

[MSG$017EE4,89]
Takashiro still seems perturbed by my behavior, but she heads back into the Faculty Room.

[MSG$017F4A,60]
I creep through the Faculty Room to escape Takashiro's gaze.

[MSG$017F8B,69]
I hastily take the key out of my pocket and put it back into the box.

[MSG$017FDD,9]
Lid shuts

[MSG$017FF3,25]
Minase "Whew! Thank God."

[MSG$018026,49]
I sigh, close the box and leave the Faculty Room.

[MSG$0180E8,75]
I continue on to the lockers, change my shoes and leave the school grounds.

[MSG$018140,68]
I go outside and gulp in the fresh air, letting it fill up my lungs.

[MSG$018191,16]
Minase "Sigh..."

[MSG$0181BB,72]
Outside, I can see a few students on their way home after team practice.

[MSG$018210,109]
They're all straggling towards the school gates, engaged in inane chatter with their friends and teammates...

[MSG$01828A,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0182A3,75]
It's hard to believe that just a few minutes ago, I was in that eerie room.

[MSG$0182FB,68]
They're two totally different worlds...that room and where I am now.

[MSG$018344,46]
A place where reality and fantasy intersect...

[MSG$018377,46]
That's the perfect way to describe that place.

[MSG$0183B2,24]
Minase "I'm going home."

[MSG$0183E4,34]
I head home along with the others.

[MSG$018413,102]
I walk through the same gate as the others. On my way home tonight, my footsteps seem a lot heavier...

[MSG$018486,23]
Because my bag's heavy?

[MSG$0184AA,61]
That's right, that book of magic is right here inside my bag.

Click...

[MSG$0185FD,20]
Minase "I'm home..."

[MSG$01862B,69]
I enter the empty, silent house, calling out to no one in particular.

[MSG$018675,55]
It's a habit of mine, from when I lived with my family.

[MSG$0186B9,42]
I kick off my shoes, and go up to my room.

[MSG$01876C,57]
Normally I'd just toss my bag onto my bed, but not today.

[MSG$0187B2,94]
Before I toss it, I open it up, remove the cloth-wrapped Book of Magic, and set it on my desk.

[MSG$01881D,49]
Then I sit down at my desk, and remove the cloth.

[MSG$01885B,71]
I take a second look at the book, this time under fluorescent lights...

[MSG$0188E2,44]
A white hexagram drawn on the black cover...

[MSG$018913,57]
It practically shouts out that it's a book about magic...

[MSG$018959,86]
But now the book gives off a different impression than when I saw it in that dim room.

[MSG$0189BC,66]
Now that it's sitting on my desk, it sticks out like a sore thumb.

[MSG$018A03,38]
It's so incongruous next to my laptop.

[MSG$018A36,54]
It's an antique-looking book that belongs in a museum.

[MSG$018A71,73]
From the looks of the studs, it's a lot older than a mere 10 or 20 years.

[MSG$018ABF,52]
A century...no, it's probably a few centuries old...

[MSG$018B00,36]
Who on earth wrote it, and for whom?

[MSG$018B29,52]
And why did I find it in that basement storage room?

[MSG$018B6A,73]
It's a total mystery, but at any rate, here it is sitting on my desk now.

[MSG$018BC0,86]
If I could only read what was in it, I might be able to unravel some of the mystery...

[MSG$018C23,38]
I unclasp the chain and open the book.

[MSG$018CCF,64]
I turn the pages and examine the writing under the fluorescents.

[MSG$018D1C,89]
The pages have yellowed, and are stained here and there. Along with the cryptic diagrams,

[MSG$018D7A,44]
there are handwritten notes laid out neatly.

[MSG$018DB3,93]
On closer examination, I see that the pages aren't made of paper...they're made of parchment.

[MSG$018E1D,98]
Parchment, made of sheepskin, was widely used in medieval Europe for writing. I've heard that it's

[MSG$018E84,86]
|still sometimes used today, but it's not something you'll often come across in Japan.

[MSG$018EE7,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$018F00,47]
I turn the pages and run my eyes over the text.

[MSG$018F3C,40]
Of course nothing really catches my eye.

[MSG$018F69,90]
I can see that it's written in the Roman alphabet, but I have no idea what language it is.

[MSG$018FD0,78]
All I can be sure of is that it's not English. Not that I'm fluent in English,

[MSG$019023,60]
but I'm not so dumb that I can't recognize it's not English.

[MSG$019064,69]
The words written on those pages are just a bunch of gibberish to me.

[MSG$0190B6,91]
It's probably French or something. No, it's probably a mix of a lot of different languages.

[MSG$019116,78]
Here and there I can see some words that aren't written in the Roman alphabet.

[MSG$019171,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$019187,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$0191A0,41]
This is not anything I can possibly read.

[MSG$0191CE,100]
If I was to try and read this with the help of a dictionary, it would take a lot of time and effort.

[MSG$01923F,109]
Whoever was the owner of this book 12 years ago must've studied like crazy, if she was able to read all this.

[MSG$0192B9,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$0192D2,60]
I stop to examine a page with a drawing of a large talisman.

[MSG$01931B,67]
Geometric shapes...complex combinations of triangles and circles...

[MSG$019363,54]
I had no idea what any of these were supposed to mean.

[MSG$0193A6,64]
Minase "I don't think they could have any kind of power, but..."

[MSG$019400,23]
I turn some more pages.

[MSG$019424,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$01943A,12]
(Turns page)

[MSG$0194A4,76]
I stared intently at the illustrations that were interspersed with the text.

[MSG$0194F5,35]
All of them were extremely bizarre.

[MSG$019525,112]
Abnormal acts of copulation, monstrous drawings of animals and humans...all of the illustrations were revolting.

[MSG$01959A,58]
My curiosity drove me to stare at these drawings intently.

[MSG$0195E1,117]
Each drawing illustrated what was going on in the book on that page. Even if you couldn't read the text, it was clear

[MSG$01965B,37]
|that a bizarre story was being told.

[MSG$01968D,36]
One of these drawings caught my eye.

[MSG$0196BE,62]
The first one showed a man and a woman having sex in a forest.

[MSG$019709,69]
Later, the woman disappears, and the man is stabbed through the head,

[MSG$019753,99]
the heart and his penis with a sword by a priest. The sword is decorated with an upside-down cross.

[MSG$0197C3,115]
The corpse is left where it is, and ripped apart by lions, who bury the body parts in the middle of a certain road.

[MSG$019843,75]
Then there's a full moon, and a sorcerer appears with a book under his arm.

[MSG$01989B,77]
The sorcerer draws a circle on the ground, adding a cross and secret symbols.

[MSG$0198F5,56]
Then he enters the circle, and begins to intone a spell.

[MSG$01993A,69]
At this point, the woman reappears, and tries to seduce the sorcerer.

[MSG$019984,84]
But the sorcerer refuses her advances, as he's protected by the power of the circle.

[MSG$0199E5,94]
Enraged, the woman changes herself into an ugly succubus, and bares her fangs at the sorcerer.

[MSG$019A48,67]
But this has no effect on the sorcerer, safe in the magical circle.

[MSG$019A98,90]
The sorcerer continues to chant his spell, until finally the succubus gives up and leaves.

[MSG$019AFF,84]
When the sorcerer finishes chanting, the man's body parts form a skeleton-shape, and

[MSG$019B58,9]
he rises.

[MSG$019B6E,112]
The sorcerer praises the heavens and lifts the book skyward. The skeleton flies up into the air toward the moon,

[MSG$019BEB,56]
After I've seen this drawing, I close the book and sigh.

[MSG$019CA8,48]
Minase "So it's a spell to raise the dead, huh?"

[MSG$019CF2,22]
What a load of crap...

[MSG$019D15,88]
I don't know what grounds or for what purpose the author had for creating this book, but

[MSG$019D72,58]
|I could only conclude that he was ridiculing his readers.

[MSG$019DB9,64]
If he'd written it in good faith, then he must be pretty insane.

[MSG$019DFE,88]
There were other similar drawings throughout the book, but it was all the same nonsense.

[MSG$019E63,57]
Still, it might be rash to label it a joke just for that.

[MSG$019EA1,48]
But could there really be such a thing as magic?

[MSG$019EDE,93]
I don't believe in that kind of thing at all, but at the very least, whoever wrote this book,

[MSG$019F40,68]
and whoever used this storage room 12 years ago did believe in it...

[MSG$019F91,46]
Or was it that they just wanted to believe it?

[MSG$01A050,8]
Click...

[MSG$01A065,17]
Voice "I'm home!"

[MSG$01A090,63]
I hear the door open. Then I hear a familiar voice calling out.

[MSG$01A0DC,15]
It's my sister.

[MSG$01A0F8,62]
I was so engrossed with this book, I lost track of the time...

[MSG$01A143,8]
Click...

[MSG$01A18A,32]
Yukiko "Hey, I said I was home!"

[MSG$01A1C4,61]
Yukiko "If you're here, the least you could do is answer me!"

[MSG$01A21B,51]
My big sister opens the door to my room and enters.

[MSG$01A253,25]
She could at least knock!

[MSG$01A279,28]
Yukiko "What are you doing?"

[MSG$01A2AF,111]
Yukiko "Well, well! You're actually studying for once, I'm impressed! Maybe I shouldn't disturb you like this."

[MSG$01A3B4,39]
My sister peers at the book on my desk.

[MSG$01A3E0,91]
It's too late for me to hide it, so I let her look. I know my sister...if I try to hide it,

[MSG$01A440,33]
she'll do anything to get a look.

[MSG$01A4E7,13]
Yukiko "Huh?"

[MSG$01A50E,66]
Yukiko "Hey, what's this? They're making you guys take Latin now?"

[MSG$01A56B,21]
Minase "Yeah, right."

[MSG$01A59A,47]
Yukiko "I know! I was only kidding, of course."

[MSG$01A5E3,78]
Yukiko "But where'd you get this book? It really is in crappy condition, huh?"

[MSG$01A64B,55]
Minase "Oh, this? I just borrowed it from school, see."

[MSG$01A69C,52]
Yukiko "And you're gonna tell me you can read this?"

[MSG$01A6EA,85]
Yukiko "Oh, you don't have to answer that. I know it's way beyond your feeble brain."

[MSG$01A759,5]
Grrr!

[MSG$01A76B,44]
Minase "I suppose YOU can read it yourself!"

[MSG$01A7B1,97]
My sister was a French Lit major, and has a good grasp of French and English and other languages.

[MSG$01A817,82]
But that's just what she says...I'm not sure how much of a linguist she really is.

[MSG$01A876,27]
Yukiko "Oh, piece of cake!"

[MSG$01A8AB,38]
My sister thumps herself on the chest.

[MSG$01A8D6,44]
Those huge breasts she's so proud of jiggle.

[MSG$01A907,30]
I have my doubts about this...

[MSG$01A932,41]
Yukiko "Here, just show your big sister."

[MSG$01A975,49]
My sister shoves me out of the way and sits down.

[MSG$01AA43,29]
Yukiko "Let's have a look..."

[MSG$01AA7A,62]
My sister flips through the pages and scans the lines of text.

[MSG$01AAC5,70]
Yukiko "What kind of a book is this? Is this religious, or something?"

[MSG$01AB25,43]
Minase "How would I know? I can't read it!"

[MSG$01AB6A,65]
That's what I tell her. I'm not going to let on it's about magic.

[MSG$01ABB8,43]
Yukiko "You're right, Stupid of me to ask."

[MSG$01ABFD,63]
Yukiko "There are a lot of religious quotes all over this book.

[MSG$01AC41,45]
There are some passages from the Gospel, too.

[MSG$01AC89,38]
My sister continues to turn the pages.

[MSG$01ACBC,60]
Yukiko "Also, it's written in a lot of different languages."

[MSG$01AD12,65]
Yukiko "It's mostly Latin and French...there's some Hebrew, too."

[MSG$01AD6D,81]
Yukiko "And there are some I can't read....Greek...and I think this is Gaelic..."

[MSG$01ADD8,56]
My sister mutters to herself as she looks over the book.

[MSG$01AE1D,53]
Minase "Never mind all that, just read it, will you?"

[MSG$01AE6C,35]
Yukiko "You make it sound so easy!"

[MSG$01AEA9,42]
She stops turning pages when she hears me.

[MSG$01AEE0,62]
Minase "Come on, you just told me it would be easy for you..."

[MSG$01AF38,69]
Yukiko "I'm not going to read it at all if you're going to complain."

[MSG$01AF97,52]
Minase "I'm sorry, please, will you read it for me?"

[MSG$01AFE5,31]
I demeaned myself to my sister.

[MSG$01B009,67]
If I got on her bad side, there's no telling what she'd make me do.

[MSG$01B059,91]
Yukiko "That's better. All right, I'm going to read this for you, my ignorant kid brother."

[MSG$01B0CE,56]
She goes back to the first page, and stares at the text.

[MSG$01B113,24]
Yukiko "It's in French."

[MSG$01B146,77]
Yukiko "It's a difficult phrase. But of course, it's a piece of cake for me."

[MSG$01B1AD,75]
Yeah, tell me about it, after you failed your entrance exam the first time!

[MSG$01B205,37]
Yukiko "Ready? I'm going to read it!"

[MSG$01B244,59]
My sister starts translating as she reads, taking her time.

[MSG$01B284,33]
This is what the first line says:

[MSG$01B2B2,69]
''Gremoire du constitutions avec un recveil des plus reres secrets.''

[MSG$01B304,82]
Yukiko "This is the great Grimoire, containing the rarest secrets in the world..."

[MSG$01B370,45]
Yukiko "Ha, ha, ha! So it's a Book of Magic!"

[MSG$01B3B7,49]
Minase "Never mind! Just keep reading, will you?"

[MSG$01B402,28]
Yukiko "Hey, don't rush me."

[MSG$01B438,73]
The next passage was long, and it took my sister a while to translate it.

[MSG$01B48E,105]
Yukiko "The great laws of magic. Here you shall find secret chants for the Holy Spirits of the Darkness."

[MSG$01B511,90]
Yukiko "The throne of the Apostles shall be assumed by the one who has been entrusted with

[MSG$01B570,34]
|the key to the Kingdom of Heaven,

[MSG$01B597,118]
|in the words of the Lord Jesus Christ to Saint Peter, ''I shall entrust thee with the key to the Kingdom of Heaven,''

[MSG$01B612,84]
and he alone shall have the power to command the Lord of Darkness and his servants."

[MSG$01B681,93]
Yukiko "And they shall be his servants also, and shall bring him honor and glory and worship.

[MSG$01B6E3,91]
Again in accordance with the Lord Jesus Christ's words, ''Thou shalt serve only one God.''"

[MSG$01B758,86]
Yukiko "By the power of the key to the Church, thou shalt become the ruler of Hell..."

[MSG$01B7C9,22]
Yukiko "What IS this?"

[MSG$01B7F9,39]
My sister tilts her head after reading.

[MSG$01B82D,45]
I had no idea myself what that was all about.

[MSG$01B867,14]
(Page turning)

[MSG$01B882,25]
My sister turns the page.

[MSG$01B8A8,48]
Yukiko "The next part is about Prayer, it says."

[MSG$01B8F3,109]
Yukiko "We pray that this book shall serve all those who read it and pray for the success of their endeavors,

[MSG$01B965,27]
and that it benefits them."

[MSG$01B99A,80]
Yukiko "By the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ with which we fill our daily cups,

[MSG$01B9EF,47]
we pray that this book serves all who read it."

[MSG$01BA38,83]
Yukiko "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, thou art purified."

[MSG$01BAA5,86]
Yukiko "After assuming the role of the ruler of Hell, thou are purified by the Father,

[MSG$01BB00,33]
the Son, and the Holy Ghost...??"

[MSG$01BB26,21]
It's backwards, huh?"

[MSG$01BB56,94]
Yukiko "The style of writing is similar to the Gospel, but what it says is the total opposite.

[MSG$01BBB9,29]
Jesus would never use magic!"

[MSG$01BBF0,14]
(page turning)

[MSG$01BC0B,115]
Yukiko "The next page is a list of what's in the book...a table of contents. There's all these ridiculous words..."

[MSG$01BC98,60]
Yukiko "All Spells...Summoning Demons...Raising the Dead..."

[MSG$01BCEE,43]
My sister starts reading the list out loud.

[MSG$01BD26,91]
Like the illustrations in the book, none of the spells sounded like they would really work.

[MSG$01BD8E,57]
Yukiko "A spell to cause a young woman to dance naked..."

[MSG$01BDE1,39]
Minase "Hey, try translating that one."

[MSG$01BE22,45]
When she hears this, my sister stops reading.

[MSG$01BE5C,19]
Yukiko "Which one?"

[MSG$01BE89,72]
Minase "You know, the one you just read, something about being naked..."

[MSG$01BEEB,72]
My sister looks exasperated and glares at me from the corner of her eye.

[MSG$01BFC9,42]
Yukiko "Why you little piss of a pervert!"

[MSG$01C01E,4]
BAM!

[MSG$01C0B3,12]
Minase "OW!"

[MSG$01C0D9,58]
My sister has slammed me in the back as hard as she could.

[MSG$01C120,31]
Minase "Go easy on me, dammit."

[MSG$01C159,32]
Yukiko "Why you little PERVERT."

[MSG$01C193,5]
Grrr!

[MSG$01C1A5,19]
Minase "Forget it!"

[MSG$01C1D2,100]
Yukiko "Now, now...Since it's for my darling little brother, I'll be happy to translate it for you."

[MSG$01C250,14]
Minase "....."

[MSG$01C26B,94]
Yukiko "All right, then, I'm going to read it to you now. Keep your ears peeled, Pervert-boy."

[MSG$01C2E3,108]
Minase "Enough of that! I only chose that one because I thought you might as well do something interesting."

[MSG$01C390,70]
My sister opens the book to the page I'd requested and begins to read.

[MSG$01C3E3,112]
Yukiko "First, you write the first letter of the woman's name in your own blood on a piece of unused parchment."

[MSG$01C46E,109]
Yukiko "Next, you wrap the parchment around a rock, and place the rock on top of the manuscript for the Mass.

[MSG$01C4E0,35]
And then recite the Lord's Prayer."

[MSG$01C51E,80]
Yukiko "Then you fill the door this woman's supposed to go through with stones."

[MSG$01C588,92]
Yukiko "And this woman will go mad. When you witness her dancing naked in a depraved manner,

[MSG$01C5E9,53]
you must look on her not with envy, but with pity..."

[MSG$01C638,38]
Yukiko "There's a warning at the end."

[MSG$01C678,80]
Yukiko "But bear this in mind...this is not for the faint of heart...Hear that?"

[MSG$01C6E2,75]
Yukiko "It doesn't say it's not for the young and depraved...Good for you!"

[MSG$01C747,35]
Minase "Oh, why don't you shut up!"

[MSG$01C784,74]
Yukiko "But it's hard to believe something like this would actually work."

[MSG$01C7E8,78]
Yukiko "Anyone who believes what this book says has to be retarded. A retard!"

[MSG$01C850,39]
So saying, my sister stares hard at me.

[MSG$01C884,103]
Yukiko "But really, I don't know how you were able to get your hands on an idiotic book like this one."

[MSG$01C905,41]
Yukiko "And when was it written, anyway?"

[MSG$01C948,60]
My sister skims through the pages of the book as she speaks.

[MSG$01C991,80]
Yukiko "I've never seen old photos like these, even at the grad school library."

[MSG$01C9FB,102]
Yukiko "And I don't know who wrote this, but I can't believe anyone would write such ridiculous crap!"

[MSG$01CA7B,80]
Yukiko "Listen, you. Don't tell me you're thinking of trying this out yourself!"

[MSG$01CAE5,53]
My sister fixes her cold gaze on me as she says this.

[MSG$01CB27,31]
Minase "None of your business!"

[MSG$01CB60,106]
Yukiko "I know you're my kid brother but I'm ashamed of you. To think you'd take this nonsense seriously!"

[MSG$01CBE4,117]
Yukiko "If you're so anxious to see someone dancing in the nude...Well, then, why don't I dance in the nude for you?"

[MSG$01CD19,66]
My sister grabs herself by her large breasts and shows them to me.

[MSG$01CD68,38]
Minase "I have no desire to see that."

[MSG$01CDA8,22]
I turn my back on her.

[MSG$01CDCB,28]
Yukiko "There you go, look!"

[MSG$01CE01,77]
My sister starts kneading her breasts, and brings them both close to my face.

[MSG$01CE5B,12]
Minase "..."

[MSG$01CE74,68]
My sister gets carried away and plops her breasts on top of my head.

[MSG$01CEC5,23]
Jiggle jiggle jiggle...

[MSG$01CEE9,56]
Yukiko "There! How do you like that? Does it feel good?"

[MSG$01CF3B,16]
Minase "......."

[MSG$01CF58,25]
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle...

[MSG$01CF7E,35]
Minase "Come on! Get away from me!"

[MSG$01CFBB,98]
I'm getting tired of my sister making fun of me, so I push her away and steer her toward the door,

[MSG$01D02A,27]
Yukiko "Are you mad at me?"

[MSG$01D05F,25]
Minase "No! But get out!"

[MSG$01D092,73]
I shove my sister out the door. She smirks as she steps into the hallway.

[MSG$01D0E8,118]
Yukiko "It's all right to read that obscene book, but don't do anything that'll get you arrested, you little pervert."

[MSG$01D178,31]
Minase "Just get the hell out!"

[MSG$01D1D5,6]
Thump!

[MSG$01D1E8,66]
I throw a pillow at her, which hits the door just as she shuts it.

[MSG$01D237,39]
For chrissake, she can be such a bitch!

[MSG$01D263,40]
I'm furious as I flop back into my seat.

[MSG$01D31D,61]
Minase "A spell that causes young women to dance naked, huh?"

[MSG$01D374,39]
What kind of a barbaric spell was that?

[MSG$01D3A8,92]
I know magic books are supposed to be dubious, but who knew that stuff could be so blatantly

[MSG$01D409,36]
|indecent? It was almost refreshing.

[MSG$01D43A,68]
But could such an obviously fraudulent spell have any actual effect?

[MSG$01D48B,78]
Why would a book that quoted the bible and Jesus also include obscene content?

[MSG$01D4E6,41]
Whatever...I'd never know unless I tried.

[MSG$01D51C,114]
I mean, I have the book right here in front of me. It wouldn't hurt to just give it one try. And if it was a fake,

[MSG$01D593,40]
then I'd be able to put my mind at rest.

[MSG$01D5C8,57]
Minase "Why don't I just try it once for the hell of it?"

[MSG$01D61B,13]
Turning pages

[MSG$01D635,58]
I open the book to the page that has what I'm looking for.

[MSG$01D674,76]
Okay, I've decided to test it, so now I have to pick a someone to use it on.

[MSG$01D6CD,26]
Minase "Who should I use?"

[MSG$01D701,76]
Even though I know it couldn't possibly work, I find myself getting excited.

[MSG$01D752,16]
Dancing naked...

[MSG$01D767,64]
If such a convenient spell existed, who wouldn't want to use it?

[MSG$01D7B4,118]
If I'm going to do this at all, I might as well use someone hot, or else there wouldn't be as much to look forward to.

[MSG$01D82F,45]
It's just a game, anyway...I should aim high.

[MSG$01D869,55]
But just in case, I'd better exempt people close to me.

[MSG$01D8A5,72]
Of course I doubt anything will happen, but it's better to play it safe.

[MSG$01D8FA,21]
So, who should it be?

[MSG$01DB67,17]
What about Imari?

[MSG$01DB7D,102]
No, I shouldn't try something like this on her. And in her own way, she does look out for me everyday.

[MSG$01DBF0,45]
Besides, I have no desire to see Imari naked.

[MSG$01DC22,49]
What would be the point of seeing her flat chest?

[MSG$01DC58,52]
And besides, we used to take baths together as kids.

[MSG$01DC99,32]
Even if I saw her breasts now...

[MSG$01DCC6,62]
Yeah, I guess I do want to get a look at her naked now, too...

[MSG$01DD09,37]
After all, she's got an adult body...

[MSG$01DD3B,23]
Jiggle jiggle jiggle...

[MSG$01DD5F,9]
No, wait.

[MSG$01DD6D,82]
Think about it...if Imari did suddenly start dancing naked in some public place...

[MSG$01DDC4,47]
...then she'd definitely be exposed as a freak.

[MSG$01DE00,98]
And as the childhood friend of this freak, as well as being the one she looks after every morning,

[MSG$01DE67,55]
then I'd be subjected to the same humiliation as Imari.

[MSG$01DEAB,90]
Every time we went outside, people would say, ''Hey, look, it's the freaky couple!'' Or...

[MSG$01DF12,79]
"They look good together, don't they? Well, sure, since they're two of a kind!"

[MSG$01DF6E,91]
''Don't get close, or you'll turn into a freak, too!'' I just know that's what they'll say.

[MSG$01DFD6,83]
And Imari and I will be thrust into the hell of a relentlessly cruel school life...

[MSG$01E02E,50]
Terrifying...just the thought of it is terrifying.

[MSG$01E290,20]
How about my sister?

[MSG$01E2A9,70]
No, if she finds out, she'll absolutely kill me, It'll be a bloodbath.

[MSG$01E2FC,71]
I mean, if I try it on her and it works, then how can she not find out?

[MSG$01E350,59]
Tremble, tremble...just thinking about it was scary enough.

[MSG$01E390,76]
My sister would be sure to pay me back 100 times over for what I did to her.

[MSG$01E3E9,65]
My sister believes in retaliating 3 times over; that's her motto.

[MSG$01E42F,93]
If in fact this spell happened to work, then she'd do something to me that was 3 times worse.

[MSG$01E499,104]
I would probably end up being my sister's slave for the rest of my life, which would be worse than hell.

[MSG$01E50E,24]
And just think about it,

[MSG$01E52B,75]
...if Yukiko did suddenly start dancing in the nude in some public place...

[MSG$01E57B,47]
...then she'd definitely be exposed as a freak.

[MSG$01E5B7,63]
And, although she was only my cousin, as a member of my family,

[MSG$01E5FB,110]
my parents and I would be shunned by society as a whole, for having the same blood in our veins as this freak,

[MSG$01E676,79]
Whenever I went out, I'd hear, ''Hey, look, he's from the Naked Family!'' Or...

[MSG$01E6D2,55]
''Maybe he's part of some weird religious cult!'' or...

[MSG$01E716,57]
''Naked jerk!'' I'm sure that's what they'd say about me.

[MSG$01E75C,35]
And this would break up the family.

[MSG$01E78C,76]
My parents would lose their jobs, bury themselves in debt and flee the city.

[MSG$01E7DD,37]
My sister would turn to prostitution,

[MSG$01E807,55]
and I myself would get hooked on some New Age religion.

[MSG$01E84B,57]
Terrifying...just the thought of all that was terrifying.

[MSG$01E933,82]
Someone not so close to me, and who had a common interest in this, would be ideal.

[MSG$01E992,21]
I can think of one...

[MSG$01E9AC,9]
Mika Ito.

[MSG$01EAFE,76]
She'd said something preposterous, that she believed in Saeki's black magic.

[MSG$01EB4F,69]
She's the one who lashed out at me today...she'd be perfect for this,

[MSG$01EBA1,84]
For me to test this magic theory...I couldn't think of a better person to try it on.

[MSG$01EBFA,99]
And since she'd be getting the chance to use her own body to find out whether magic existed or not,

[MSG$01EC62,35]
it should be an honor for her, too.

[MSG$01EC92,22]
Okay, I'd go with Ito.

[MSG$01ECB5,73]
Whether or not there really was magic, I'd still get something out of it.

[MSG$01ED0B,9]
(Giggles)

[MSG$01ED21,47]
Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face.

[MSG$01ED55,22]
It's just too perfect.

[MSG$01EDAC,52]
Minase "No, hang on. Just calm down for a second..."

[MSG$01EDFA,106]
I realized how carried away I was getting, and put an abrupt stop to this out-of-control train of thought.

[MSG$01EE69,91]
I'd let my imagination run wild, but come to think of it, why was I taking it so seriously?

[MSG$01EED1,62]
There's no such thing as magic. I was the one who'd said that.

[MSG$01EF14,79]
But here I was thinking about what was going to happen if there actually was...

[MSG$01EF68,36]
I might be the biggest moron of all.

[MSG$01EF91,56]
I'm no different than Saeki and her group of supporters.

[MSG$01EFD6,106]
Better to keep things casual. If I got my expectations up, I'd only be disappointed when nothing happened.

[MSG$01F04D,39]
At any rate, I had myself a guinea pig.

[MSG$01F081,11]
Mika Ito...

[MSG$01F099,86]
She wasn't bad-looking at all, and she was one of the more popular women in our class.

[MSG$01F0F4,70]
I'm sure all the guys would really appreciate her dancing in the nude.

[MSG$01F147,113]
No, this is strictly an experiment to find out whether or not there magic exists. The nude part was just a bonus.

[MSG$01F1BD,26]
That's what I told myself.

[MSG$01F1E4,39]
And then I remembered the storage room.

[MSG$01F218,113]
If the rumor about what happened there was true, then this book might be more powerful than anyone could imagine.

[MSG$01F28E,39]
I'm going to have to keep that in mind.

[MSG$01F2C2,57]
Now that everything's settled, I start my preparations...

[MSG$01F300,89]
Judging by the translation I'd heard, the spell itself didn't seem to be too complicated.

[MSG$01F366,21]
Minase "Let's see..."

[MSG$01F395,28]
I look at my sister's notes.

[MSG$01F3BE,112]
Minase "First, you write the first letter of the woman's name in your own blood on a piece of unused parchment."

[MSG$01F448,90]
There's no way I'd have any parchment on me, and no chance I could get my hands on some...

[MSG$01F4AF,73]
Minase "I'm just going to substitute that with an unused piece of paper."

[MSG$01F512,110]
Minase "Next, you wrap the parchment around a rock, and place the rock on top of the manuscript for the Mass."

[MSG$01F59A,55]
Manuscript for the Mass...The book must mean the bible.

[MSG$01F5D6,65]
I'm pretty sure there's a bible lying around the house somewhere.

[MSG$01F61C,73]
Judging by the content of the Book of Magic, the New Testament should do.

[MSG$01F672,45]
Minase "And then recite the Lord's Prayer..."

[MSG$01F6BA,66]
Lord's Prayer? There's one in the book, but it's written in Latin.

[MSG$01F701,78]
Oh well, even if I don't understand what it says, I can just read it out loud.

[MSG$01F75C,81]
Minase "Next, I have to bury the stone under a door the woman will pass through."

[MSG$01F7C7,90]
It's easier than I thought...If that's all you needed to do to get a woman to dance naked,

[MSG$01F826,45]
then there would be no need for strip joints.

[MSG$01F860,76]
Minase "Finally, bury the stone under a door the woman will pass through..."

[MSG$01F8C6,104]
Door? I don't know where Ito lives. I can probably find out her address if I look at the class register.

[MSG$01F933,104]
But it just has to be any door, so the school would be the best place, since she's sure to pass through.

[MSG$01FA30,81]
A few minutes later, I had everything I needed for the spell laid out on my desk.

[MSG$01FA8E,73]
It's not exactly what the book calls for, but I'm sure it's close enough.

[MSG$01FAE4,66]
Minase "First, write down the first letter of the woman's name..."

[MSG$01FB40,77]
I take a box cutter from my desk, press against my finger and slash sideways.

[MSG$01FB9A,14]
Minase "Ouch!"

[MSG$01FBC2,42]
There's a cut on my finger about 5mm long.

[MSG$01FBF1,62]
Small red bubbles appear on the cut, then drip down my finger.

[MSG$01FC34,37]
I catch the blood drops as they fall.

[MSG$01FC66,82]
I wrap a Band-Aid around my finger, and put a fresh piece of paper in front of me.

[MSG$01FCC5,104]
Then I dip a sharpened chopstick in the blood, and inscribe a single letter on the blank piece of paper.

[MSG$01FD8B,33]
Minase "Guess that should do it."

[MSG$01FDC6,78]
I dry the sheet, then pick up a stone I found that seems to be the right size.

[MSG$01FE21,76]
Then I wrap the sheet of paper around the stone, and drop it onto the bible.

[MSG$01FEF7,32]
Minase "The Lord's Prayer, huh?"

[MSG$01FF31,31]
I recite the words in the book.

[MSG$01FF5D,42]
Minase "Pater noster, qui es in caelis..."

[MSG$01FFA1,60]
I begin to read the long passage in a calm, mechanical tone.

[MSG$01FFEA,65]
Minase "Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo."

[MSG$020045,16]
Minase "Amen..."

[MSG$02006F,97]
Finally I'm finished, and I'm all set. Now all I have to do is bury the stone in the proper spot.

[MSG$0200DD,27]
Minase "I'm all set to go."

[MSG$02018E,43]
Looking at the clock, I see that it's nine.

[MSG$0201C6,54]
I can go over to the school now and bury this thing...

[MSG$020201,61]
Now that I've come this far, I can't wait to see the results.

[MSG$020243,87]
According to my calculations, if I bury it now, the moment of truth will come tomorrow.

[MSG$0202A7,56]
But if nothing comes out of all this...what a rip-off...

[MSG$020382,65]
I stick the wrapped stone in my pocket and slip out of the house.

[MSG$0203C8,52]
And I rush down the dark streets towards the school.

[MSG$020462,26]
April 20 - School at Night

[MSG$020518,74]
Some 10 minutes later, I'm standing in front of the deserted school gates.

[MSG$02056F,46]
The sky is dark, and the night breeze is cold.

[MSG$0205AA,46]
The ominously silent school is in front of me.

[MSG$0205DD,69]
At this hour, there's no question that the school is locked up tight.

[MSG$02062F,89]
It's pitch dark inside as well. All I can see are the emergency lights along the hallway.

[MSG$02068D,48]
The faculty room appears to be deserted as well.

[MSG$0206CA,67]
I make sure no one's around to see me, and climb up the black gate.

[MSG$02071A,20]
Minase "Here we go."

[MSG$020748,8]
Thump...

[MSG$020763,74]
Some 10 minutes later, I'm standing in front of the deserted school gates.

[MSG$0207BA,46]
The ominously silent school is in front of me.

[MSG$0207ED,69]
At this hour, there's no question that the school is locked up tight.

[MSG$02083F,89]
It's pitch dark inside as well. All I can see are the emergency lights along the hallway.

[MSG$02089D,83]
But the gates are still open; maybe that means someone's still in the Faculty Room.

[MSG$0208FD,65]
I make sure no one's around to see me, and walk through the gate.

[MSG$0209C7,60]
I climb over the wall and land safely on the school grounds.

[MSG$020A10,56]
There's something different about being here at night...

[MSG$020A4D,75]
There's a cold breeze in the deserted schoolyard, and I feel it on my face.

[MSG$020AA5,58]
The school building looks almost like a huge gravestone...

[MSG$020AE4,46]
And I'll be the only one walking through it...

[MSG$020B1F,21]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$020B96,57]
Somewhere she'll have to pass to get into the building...

[MSG$020BD4,48]
And somewhere I'll be able to bury this stone...

[MSG$020C09,28]
Where would be a good place?

[MSG$020C32,45]
There's nowhere I can dig a hole around here.

[MSG$020C64,25]
There's only one place...

[MSG$020C8A,52]
I'm pretty sure I can do it in front of the lockers.

[MSG$020D01,58]
It has to be a place where she'll be sure to pass through.

[MSG$020D48,108]
She'll definitely have to pass through the school gate, but there's no place to bury the stone around there.

[MSG$020DC1,39]
Where else is she sure to walk through?

[MSG$020E6F,41]
April 20 - Ground in front of the lockers

[MSG$020F18,33]
I arrive in front of the lockers.

[MSG$020F46,87]
I look down at the ground, I'm sure I can dig a hole there, but not with just my hands.

[MSG$020FAA,72]
I squat down and start scratching out a hole with a stick I find nearby.

[MSG$020FF7,63]
I choose a spot near the entrance to the lockers for our class.

[MSG$021043,7]
Digging

[MSG$021057,48]
Minase "I don't know what the hell I'm doing..."

[MSG$0210A1,87]
Minase "Damn...if nothing comes of all this labor, it's going to be that book's fault!"

[MSG$021112,76]
I go on muttering like this as I continue to scratch a hole into the ground.

[MSG$021163,75]
At last I have a hole the stone can fit in. I dump the stone into the hole.

[MSG$0211BB,49]
I cover it up with dirt so no one will ever know.

[MSG$0211F1,87]
Once the hole's completely hidden, I stomp all over it so it'll be totally camouflaged.

[MSG$02124D,37]
I'm sure nobody will ever notice now.

[MSG$02127F,78]
Now I just have to wait for tomorrow. All I can do now is just watch silently.

[MSG$0212DA,108]
I dust the dirt off my hands, then leave the school grounds just as I came, climbing over the school gate...

[MSG$0213A4,21]
April 20 - Night/Home

[MSG$021457,75]
By the time I get home, have a late dinner, and take a bath, it's midnight.

[MSG$0214AF,37]
Minase "I should get some sleep now."

[MSG$0214EE,76]
I close the book, which I'd left open on my desk. Then I turn out the light.

[MSG$021547,43]
I slide into bed, and think about tomorrow.

[MSG$02157F,74]
A lot of things happened today, but now all I can think about is tomorrow.

[MSG$0215CE,103]
Not that I believe in this magic business, but I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't expecting something.

[MSG$021642,45]
All my questions will be answered tomorrow...

[MSG$02167C,9]
.........

[MSG$021692,6]
......

[MSG$0216A5,3]
