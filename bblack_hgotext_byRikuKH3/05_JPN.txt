[MSG$000150,4]
No

[MSG$000171,8]
Yes

[MSG$00019E,24]
Make him run through the school naked

[MSG$0001D3,24]
Humiliate him in front of the school gate

[MSG$000210,12]
Go the basement room

[MSG$000241,16]
Wake her up more violently

[MSG$00026E,32]
Play a prank to get back at her

[MSG$0002B3,16]
Give in to Kitami

[MSG$0002E0,14]
Reject Kitami

[MSG$000313,12]
Have her swallow it

[MSG$00033C,12]
Come all over her

[MSG$00036D,16]
Give in to Kitami

[MSG$00039A,8]
Ignore Kitami

[MSG$0003BF,12]
Turn her down

[MSG$000533,14]
April 24 - Morning

[MSG$000625,29]
Imari "Wake up..."

[MSG$00065C,29]
Imari "It's morning..."

[MSG$000693,57]
Imari "Jeez, why does it have to be this way every single day?"

[MSG$0006E6,45]
Imari "Come on, get up this instant!"

[MSG$00072D,24]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$0007E2,37]
Imari "Oh, man...I guess I have no choice."

[MSG$000821,63]
Imari rummages under the bed and picks something up.

[MSG$00086D,27]
Imari "Here it is!"

[MSG$0008A2,23]
What was under the bed again?

[MSG$0008C6,53]
Imari "I'd better be careful not to mess up this time..."

[MSG$000915,63]
Imari "Let's see, since you're supposed to turn it in opposite direction of the screws, that means..."

[MSG$00096E,67]
Muttering all the while, Imari slips something around my leg, just like yesterday.

[MSG$000A59,14]
Ghaaa...!

[MSG$000A74,41]
Instantly I shove away my blanket and jump up.

[MSG$000AAA,28]
Minase "What the hell are you doing?"

[MSG$000AE0,18]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$000B0C,29]
Imari "I haven't done anything yet."

[MSG$000B43,16]
As if I'd let her!

[MSG$000B60,62]
Besides, I can see that she's got the voltage wrong again!

[MSG$000BA3,48]
Is she one of those people who's never even used a screwdriver before?

[MSG$000BE0,61]
Imari "But it's great that you got up on your own!"

[MSG$000C37,55]
If she's going to wake me up with that torture device, I'd rather not sleep at all.

[MSG$000C73,63]
I'd better hide that contraption somewhere by the end of the day....

[MSG$000CBF,43]
Imari "What an unbelievable device, huh?"

[MSG$000D04,20]
You're the one who's unbelievable!

[MSG$000D25,20]
April 24 - Going to School

[MSG$000DC4,49]
Imari and I walk to school together.

[MSG$000E02,47]
Imari "You're really popular these days, Minase."

[MSG$000E4B,37]
Imari brings up this subject all of a sudden.

[MSG$000E7D,16]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$000EA7,43]
Imari "You're always being surrounded during every study hall."

[MSG$000EEC,88]
Come to think of it, ever since that incident with Murai, all these girls keep coming up to me during study hall,

[MSG$000F49,17]
hoping I'll cast spells for them.

[MSG$000F67,66]
Needless to say, I always turn them down. I can't take all their requests or I'll never be through with them.

[MSG$000FAE,61]
Besides, I've got to avoid generating any more weird gossip.

[MSG$000FF8,33]
Minase "It's just a pain in the ass for me."

[MSG$001033,35]
Imari "Liar...you know you're enjoying it!"

[MSG$001070,41]
Imari "I don't know, you're acting pretty strange these days..."

[MSG$0010B3,76]
Imari "Always reading weird books, practicing black magic...it's really strange."

[MSG$001119,52]
Minase "So what? It's not like I'm causing you any trouble."

[MSG$001167,22]
Imari "Yes, you are!"

[MSG$001197,31]
Imari "Oh, yes you are..."

[MSG$0011D0,65]
Imari "These days, it's getting harder and harder to get you out of bed, and also..."

[MSG$00122B,53]
Who's she to talk? Imari's acting pretty weird herself today.

[MSG$001265,37]
I guess she's still holding a grudge from what happened yesterday.

[MSG$001297,31]
Minase "I'm guessing you've got your period today."

[MSG$001369,12]
Bam!

[MSG$001382,24]
Imari "You jerk!"

[MSG$0013B4,37]
Imari "The heck with you, anyway! I'm going on ahead!"

[MSG$0013F3,39]
With that, Imari storms off.

[MSG$00141F,29]
I was only kidding...

[MSG$001449,18]
April 24 - Locker

[MSG$001538,35]
I happen to see Nonogusa in the locker area.

[MSG$001560,37]
Nonogusa notices me too and looks over.

[MSG$001592,47]
Nonogusa gives me a glance, then quickly looks away.

[MSG$0015F2,25]
It's a very awkward moment...

[MSG$001618,51]
She might've guessed that I stole some of the photos.

[MSG$001650,39]
But it's too late for me to give them back to her now...

[MSG$0016B6,22]
Imari "What's going on?"

[MSG$0016E6,25]
Minase "Nothing."

[MSG$001752,33]
I happen to see Nonogusa at the locker area.

[MSG$001778,37]
Nonogusa notices me too and looks over.

[MSG$0017AA,29]
Nonogusa "Good morning, Minase."

[MSG$0017E2,19]
Minase "Good morning."

[MSG$00180F,45]
I return Nonogusa's cheery greeting.

[MSG$001849,29]
Nonogusa "Thanks for the other day."

[MSG$001880,15]
Minase "No problem."

[MSG$0018CD,45]
She smiles at me and goes off to class.

[MSG$00198A,22]
Imari "What's going on?"

[MSG$0019BA,80]
Imari "Wasn't that Nonogusa? That girl you used to always pick on? Giving her horrible nicknames?"

[MSG$001A24,15]
Minase "Yeah."

[MSG$001A4D,32]
Imari "So what happened the other day?"

[MSG$001A87,49]
Minase "She was getting picked on, so I helped her out, that's all."

[MSG$001AD2,23]
Imari "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$001B03,79]
Imari "Hey, that reminds me, I heard Nonogusa-san's going to be the new swim team captain.

[MSG$001B57,11]
One my friends on the team told me."

[MSG$001B7C,19]
Minase "Really?"

[MSG$001BA9,53]
It sounds like those photos were more effective than I thought.

[MSG$001BEB,16]
April 24 - Classroom

[MSG$001C7A,45]
When I get to my classroom, there are already a few other students there...

[MSG$001CAC,19]
Saeki's one of them.

[MSG$001CFE,21]
Saeki "Good morning."

[MSG$001D2D,59]
Saeki greets me as if nothing happened yesterday.

[MSG$001D6D,47]
So she's got her school face on at school, huh?

[MSG$001DC2,33]
Minase "Okay, why don't you give it back to me, then?"

[MSG$001DFD,49]
I hold out my hand, intending to get my book back from Saeki.

[MSG$001E3B,60]
Saeki "Could you wait a little longer? Don't worry, I have it with me."

[MSG$001E91,35]
Saeki taps her bag.

[MSG$001EB9,37]
True, her bag is bulging.

[MSG$001EEB,27]
Minase "Well, give it back by the end of the day."

[MSG$001F20,43]
With that, I head toward my own seat.

[MSG$001F50,57]
What the hell, as long as she brought it with her, I'll just wait until after school.

[MSG$001F9C,15]
Minase "Okay."

[MSG$001FC5,59]
I try to look as indifferent as possible, and go to my own seat.

[MSG$002063,55]
Murai "Hey, Minase, I want you to cast another spell for me."

[MSG$0020B5,41]
The second I do, Murai pounces on me.

[MSG$0020EB,19]
Here it comes...

[MSG$002103,67]
At first I liked getting all the attention, but now it's a pain in the ass.

[MSG$002153,39]
Minase "I just did one for you the other day."

[MSG$002194,57]
Murai "Well, the thing is, for a virile guy he finishes way too fast..."

[MSG$0021E7,70]
Murai "So I was wondering if...if you had a spell that would make him last longer."

[MSG$002247,37]
Murai clasps her hands together in a beseeching manner.

[MSG$002271,76]
What the hell does she want me to do, anyway? If he comes too fast, then tie up his prick!

[MSG$0022CA,43]
Minase "Sorry...I'm not in the mood today."

[MSG$00230F,70]
I say this in a disgusted tone. Of course, I have no intention of ever casting a spell for her again.

[MSG$002362,65]
If I did as she asked, I'd soon be swamped with requests.

[MSG$0023A8,69]
Why the hell should I have to listen to someone bitching about their sex life?

[MSG$00242C,53]
Murai "Whaaa? Minase, you're just being mean!"

[MSG$00247B,45]
Minase "Go ask Saeki to help you out with that kind of problem."

[MSG$0024C2,62]
Murai "Can't you see I'm asking you because I respect your power? Please!"

[MSG$00251A,27]
To be blunt, it's a huge pain in the ass.

[MSG$00253A,43]
I ignore Murai and put my head down on my desk.

[MSG$002572,25]
Minase "Zzzzz..."

[MSG$0025A5,53]
Murai "Come on, don't pretend to be asleep!"

[MSG$0025F4,17]
Minase "..."

[MSG$002612,16]
Murai "Come on!"

[MSG$002726,29]
Eventually class starts.

[MSG$0027EA,18]
April 24 - Lunch

[MSG$002883,41]
The bell rings and lunch hour begins.

[MSG$0028B9,45]
Girl 1 "Hey, Minase, let's eat together."

[MSG$002900,19]
Girl "Me too!"

[MSG$00292D,84]
Imari had been on her way to my desk with her little lunchbox in her hands, but

[MSG$002986,31]
she sees what's happening and goes back to her own desk, looking sad.

[MSG$0029B2,49]
Things have changed for me, somehow.

[MSG$0029E8,57]
In recent days it feels as though I've started to lose control...

[MSG$002A2E,86]
These girls who've started surrounding me...you can tell they're only trying to get on my

[MSG$002A89,15]
|good side, because I've suddenly become a hot topic.

[MSG$002AA5,69]
I'll bet they're only thinking it might come in handy sometime to have me for a friend.

[MSG$002AEF,43]
I'd take Imari over this bunch any day.

[MSG$002B27,37]
I take the lunch my sister made for me out of my bag.

[MSG$002B51,89]
I see those girls dragging their chairs over to my desk, clutching their lunchboxes.

[MSG$002BB7,19]
Minase "(sighs)"

[MSG$002BE4,64]
It's not that I don't like the idea of eating with the girls. But for some reason it makes me sigh.

[MSG$002C31,12]
Slam!

[MSG$002C52,89]
Just then, the door slams open, shattering the lunchtime peace. A group of guys is muscling their way into the room.

[MSG$002CB8,39]
Instantly, the room grows quiet.

[MSG$002CEC,47]
These guys are part of our school's most notorious gangs.

[MSG$002D20,61]
They're stereotypical delinquents, now a rare sight on co-ed campuses such as ours.

[MSG$002D62,39]
I hear they pretty much rule the school.

[MSG$002D96,77]
Some idiot must've rubbed these jerks the wrong way...

[MSG$002DF0,79]
These thugs will pick a fight with you at the drop of a hat. On top of that,

[MSG$002E44,50]
|I've heard they do drugs, too. It's safer not to get involved with the likes of them.

[MSG$002E83,22]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$002EA6,61]
They're headed my way, kicking aside all nearby desks and chairs.

[MSG$002EF0,47]
An arrogant guy named Inoue leads the way.

[MSG$002F24,71]
He looks pretty tough, but there's no telling if he really is...

[MSG$002F78,63]
But who the hell could it be? The moron who's going to get dragged away by this gang?

[MSG$00303F,43]
Inoue "Are you Minase? Come with us."

[MSG$003084,36]
Huh? They're after ME?

[MSG$0030B5,44]
Girl 1 "Oh, sorry, I just remembered something I have to do."

[MSG$0030FB,22]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$00311E,21]
Girl 2 "Me, too..."

[MSG$00314D,22]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$003170,79]
All at once, the girls who'd been surrounding me scatter in all directions.

[MSG$0031C4,29]
Like, thanks a lot!

[MSG$0031EE,30]
Minase "I think you've got the wrong guy."

[MSG$003226,30]
I say this to Inoue in a timid voice.

[MSG$003249,49]
I don't remember ever picking a fight with them, or getting baited by them either.

[MSG$003287,38]
Inoue "Aren't you Taki Minase?"

[MSG$0032E7,27]
Minase "No..."

[MSG$00331C,23]
I reply timidly.

[MSG$003340,42]
Inoue "Then who the hell is this Minase guy?"

[MSG$003384,25]
Minase "I don't know..."

[MSG$0033B7,31]
Desperately I avert my gaze.

[MSG$0033E3,70]
No way am I going to get away with a lame lie like that. But maybe I can stall for time...

[MSG$003436,30]
Inoue "Then what's that?"

[MSG$00346E,33]
Inoue is staring at my lunchbox.

[MSG$003494,69]
The name ''Taki Minase'' is written in huge letters on it.

[MSG$0034E6,19]
Darn...

[MSG$003506,57]
My sister wrote that against my wishes, so no one would take it by mistake.

[MSG$00354C,27]
Inoue "Are you messing with me or what?"

[MSG$003581,21]
Shit...

[MSG$0035A3,22]
Inoue "Take him away!'

[MSG$0035DE,23]
Minase "Yes..."

[MSG$00360F,17]
I answer honestly.

[MSG$00362D,23]
Inoue "Then there's no mistake."

[MSG$00365E,23]
I guess they are after me...

[MSG$00367A,87]
What should I do? I can't use magic to get out of this. Plus, I have no confidence when it comes to fights.

[MSG$0036DE,22]
Inoue "Take him away!"

[MSG$003732,75]
With that, the gang surrounds me and drags me out of the classroom.

[MSG$0037BC,41]
Imari "What do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$0037FF,16]
April 24 - Roof

[MSG$00389A,43]
The gang drags me up to the roof.

[MSG$00394D,50]
Inoue "Listen, punk, do you know why we brought you here?"

[MSG$003999,19]
I shake my head.

[MSG$0039B9,37]
Minase "What did I ever do to you?"

[MSG$0039F8,43]
I'm perfectly aware that it will do me no good to ask them that.

[MSG$003A28,37]
Jerks like these don't need a reason.

[MSG$003A5A,67]
For them, this is no more than a way to kill time, something to do when they're bored.

[MSG$003AA2,41]
But I wish I knew why they'd picked me...

[MSG$003AD8,43]
Inoue "I hear you're popular with the girls these days, Minase!"

[MSG$003B1D,84]
Inoue "We've heard all the rumors. You've become the big man on campus using Black Magic, isn't that right?"

[MSG$003B8B,56]
Inoue "What are you gonna do? Summon a demon and take over the world?"

[MSG$003BDD,51]
The guys behind him snicker at these words.

[MSG$003C15,39]
Who knew the rumors had spread this far?

[MSG$003C49,42]
Inoue "We want you to show us, see. Show us your power!"

[MSG$003C8D,19]
Minase "(chokes)"

[MSG$003CBA,47]
Inoue "You're an eyesore...a moron like you."

[MSG$003D03,67]
Inoue "Thanks to your spells, we've been hearing all kinds of complaints."

[MSG$003D60,34]
Inoue "What are you gonna do about that, huh?"

[MSG$003D9C,25]
They're talking about the Murai incident...

[MSG$003DC2,61]
After Murai, I'd cast the same spell for a bunch of girls...

[MSG$003E04,51]
It's not surprising that some people would bear a grudge against me, hearing about my Black Magic.

[MSG$003E44,86]
The guy Murai was after...I'd forced him to break up with his girlfriend, after all,

[MSG$003E9F,13]
I'm sure she's got it in for me.

[MSG$003ED4,55]
Inoue "And besides, I can't stand guys like you."

[MSG$003F25,84]
Inoue "Dweebs like you who get off on something like Black Magic, Just looking at you pisses me off."

[MSG$003F93,43]
Inoue "Plus I'm in a really bad mood today."

[MSG$003FD8,81]
Inoue "I stepped in dog shit on my way here this morning...I got a ticket for parking my bike in front of my house,

[MSG$00402E,28]
so now my license's suspended!"

[MSG$004064,66]
Inoue "And it's all because of you. So now I'm gonna make you pay!"

[MSG$0040C0,25]
What the hell is he talking about?

[MSG$0040E6,62]
Inoue "So that's the deal. Don't blame me, you only have yourself to blame!"

[MSG$004144,66]
Inoue "Also...I hear you're going out with Rika Shiraki!"

[MSG$0041A0,41]
Inoue spits this out at me with an even scarier look on his face.

[MSG$0041CE,31]
Where did that rumor come from?

[MSG$0041FA,67]
Inoue "Someone saw you feeling Shiraki's breasts behind the school."

[MSG$004257,19]
So someone saw us.

[MSG$004277,35]
Inoue "I've never even touched them yet, dammit!"

[MSG$0042B4,72]
Inoue "How dare you put your hands on the tits of our Idol...You're dead!"

[MSG$004316,71]
Inoue "I wanna massage those tits of Shiraki's too, see? Know what I'm saying, asshole?"

[MSG$004377,50]
Inoue's fists are trembling. He's way serious...

[MSG$0043B6,44]
Inoue "So how far did you get with Shiraki?"

[MSG$0043FC,56]
Inoue "Don't tell me you went all the way, dickhead!"

[MSG$00444E,53]
Inoue asks me this as he cracks his knuckles.

[MSG$004488,45]
Depending on my answer, I could get killed...

[MSG$0044C2,17]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0044E0,57]
Inoue "I know you massaged her tits. Don't tell me nothing happened!"

[MSG$004533,35]
Inoue "Tell me exactly what went down, dammit!"

[MSG$004570,53]
Inoue "Depending on what you tell me...you're going to be in deep shit."

[MSG$0045BF,48]
It's a threat. It's like he's telling me not to tell him the truth.

[MSG$0045F4,43]
At any rate, I've got to talk my way out of this somehow.

[MSG$00462C,59]
Inoue "I hear you two went into the storage room in the gym after that."

[MSG$004681,17]
Shit...

[MSG$004697,29]
I had no idea someone had seen THAT.

[MSG$0046C1,42]
Inoue "Now what were doing in there, huh, Minase?"

[MSG$004705,42]
Inoue "You weren't having a friendly calisthenics session, were you?"

[MSG$004749,21]
Minase "You see..."

[MSG$004778,68]
Inoue "Tell me the truth. No matter what you say, you signed your own death sentence when you massaged her breasts."

[MSG$0047D6,21]
Minase "Hey, come on!"

[MSG$004805,50]
Inoue "Tell me, dammit! Did you or didn't you?"

[MSG$004851,23]
Minase "I...I..."

[MSG$004882,72]
What have I got to lose now? No matter what I say, he's going to kill me anyway.

[MSG$0048D7,23]
Minase "I did."

[MSG$004908,22]
Snap...

[MSG$00492B,25]
Inoue loses it when he hears my answer.

[MSG$004951,24]
Inoue "I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$004983,76]
Inoue "You bastard, I was supposed to be Rika Shiraki's first time, don't you know that's what I decided a long time ago?"

[MSG$0049E9,22]
Inoue "Beat the crap out of him!"

[MSG$004A19,39]
All at once, the whole gang jumps me.

[MSG$004AE2,10]
Pow!

[MSG$004AF9,20]
Minase "(chokes)"

[MSG$004B27,57]
Nobody's pulling any punches, and I go flying. I'm pummeled to the ground.

[MSG$004B65,33]
Sparks are going off inside my head, and I'm in a daze.

[MSG$004C2C,8]
Whack!

[MSG$004C41,18]
Minase "(gags)"

[MSG$004C6D,47]
Now that I'm on the ground, I'm getting kicked mercilessly.

[MSG$004CA9,38]
Thug 1 "Don't mess with us, you little punk!"

[MSG$004D81,10]
Whack!

[MSG$004D98,20]
Minase "(gags)"

[MSG$004DC6,54]
Thug 2 "You little dweeb! Why don't you just go home and jerk off!"

[MSG$004EAF,10]
Being pummeled...

[MSG$004F5B,10]
Whack!

[MSG$004F72,75]
I'm helpless. I have no choice but to let them pound away at me, and just try to endure the pain.

[MSG$004FCA,58]
Inoue "Dammit, get up, Minase! It's too early for bedtime!"

[MSG$00501E,41]
With that Inoue forces me to stand up.

[MSG$005054,79]
Inoue "Don't think you're gonna get off with a little beating like this. We're gonna make sure

[MSG$0050A8,11]
|we put you in the hospital for at least a week."

[MSG$0050CD,59]
Inoue smirks when he sees the suffering on my face.

[MSG$00510D,43]
He draws back his fist to strike me again.

[MSG$005145,26]
Imari "Stop it right now!"

[MSG$005179,37]
All of a sudden, a voice reverberates across the rooftop.

[MSG$005209,21]
Minase "Imari..."

[MSG$005238,31]
I whisper her name when I see who just spoke.

[MSG$005264,27]
Imari's standing there.

[MSG$005284,35]
She's glaring at the guys.

[MSG$0052AC,33]
She must've come up here, worried about me.

[MSG$0052DA,83]
I know it's lame to have a girl stand up for me, but at this moment, there's no sweeter sight for sore eyes...

[MSG$00533A,26]
Inoue "Who the hell are you?"

[MSG$00536E,77]
Inoue shoves me aside. He stands there glaring suspiciously at this brash-looking girl who just appeared.

[MSG$0053C8,33]
Imari "That kid's classmate."

[MSG$005403,46]
Inoue "So what do you want, Classmate?"

[MSG$00544B,55]
Imari "3 against 1? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?"

[MSG$00549C,80]
Inoue "Nope, it doesn't bother me at all. Anyway, I could take a guy like him on my own, no problem."

[MSG$005506,72]
Just listen to him...Although it's true that I don't think I have a chance against him even one-on-one.

[MSG$005553,61]
These guys are always fighting, so someone like me must be mere clay in their hands.

[MSG$00559D,47]
Imari "If you don't stop beating up on him, I'll take you on myself!"

[MSG$0055E6,47]
Imari stands in front of the gang and makes this gallant proclamation.

[MSG$005622,63]
I'm sure it would be a comical sight to someone who didn't know what was going on.

[MSG$005666,50]
3 guys against 1 girl. Plus they're way bigger than she is.

[MSG$0056FB,69]
Inoue "Hey, listen! Don't think just because you're a girl that I won't hit you.

[MSG$005745,60]
Sorry, but I'm no feminist. I don't have a problem hitting girls."

[MSG$00579B,55]
The guys look insulted by Imari's words.

[MSG$0057D7,37]
They have no idea how tough she is.

[MSG$005809,81]
Imari's been taking shorinji kempo lessons since she was small. My parents forced me to take lessons with her too,

[MSG$00585F,25]
but I didn't stick with it for long.

[MSG$005885,65]
Imari always finished what she starts, so she's been practicing ever since.

[MSG$0058CB,37]
She's even won a national tournament.

[MSG$0058FD,49]
She's got what it takes to make short work of your average male thug.

[MSG$00593B,82]
Imari "Fine by me. Besides, if you try to hold back I might really do some serious damage to you."

[MSG$0059A7,31]
Inoue "Listen to you shoot off your mouth."

[MSG$0059E0,59]
Inoue "Hey, make this stupid little bitch grovel on the ground!"

[MSG$005A35,23]
Thug 1 "Just leave it to me."

[MSG$005A66,69]
One of the thugs advances with a nasty leer on his face.

[MSG$005B1C,35]
Imari "Don't underestimate me because I'm a girl."

[MSG$005B59,65]
Thug 1 "No sweat, after I knock you out, I'm gonna lick your tits."

[MSG$005BB4,71]
He grins lewdly at Imari as he advances, fists aimed at Imari's face.

[MSG$005CA0,14]
Whack!

[MSG$005CBB,67]
Imari casually deflects his right hook with a chop of her right hand.

[MSG$005D0B,91]
Then she balls that hand into a fist, and pummels the thug in the face with blinding force.

[MSG$005E0C,12]
Slam!

[MSG$005E25,21]
Thug 1 "Ugh..."

[MSG$005E78,55]
With a sickening thud, her fist sinks into the thug's cheek.

[MSG$005EB4,57]
The thug covers his face with both hands, then sinks to his knees.

[MSG$005EFA,53]
Blood squirts from his fingers.

[MSG$005F6E,31]
Imari "What did I tell you?"

[MSG$005FF8,43]
Imari waves her right hand with a cool look on her face.

[MSG$006028,41]
So it's the guy who's ended up groveling on the ground...

[MSG$00605E,62]
Imari "Forgot to mention that I'm a black belt in shorinji kempo. Sorry!"

[MSG$00610C,21]
Inoue "You little..."

[MSG$00613B,83]
Seeing his crony knocked down with a single punch, Inoue begins to tremble with rage.

[MSG$00619B,57]
Inoue "Shorinji kempo or not, you're still nothing but a girl."

[MSG$0061EE,71]
Inoue "We got all our training on the streets. We'll show you the difference!"

[MSG$00624F,59]
Inoue motions with his eyes, and the other guy slowly advances.

[MSG$00628F,77]
Despite Inoue's tough talk, this thug is clearly rattled by what he just saw from Imari.

[MSG$00634D,30]
Thug 2 "Go to hell, bitch!"

[MSG$0063D6,83]
He rushes toward Imari menacingly, and unleashes a full-on kick at Imari.

[MSG$00642E,77]
You can hear the sound of his boot slicing the air in an arc towards her body.

[MSG$006488,45]
But at the last second, Imari dodges the blow.

[MSG$0064C2,59]
The thug's kick misses its target, and he loses balance.

[MSG$00650A,59]
Without a moment's hesitation, Imari aims a kick of her own at his side, which is wide open to attack.

[MSG$006552,90]
Making a half-turn with her left foot, her other foot sails through the air in a clean arc,

[MSG$0065B1,29]
and she sinks her frail-looking foot into his side.

[MSG$006673,14]
Thud!

[MSG$00668E,16]
Thug 2 "!!!"

[MSG$0066CF,79]
The thug doesn't even have time to yell before he goes flying through the air sideways. Soon he's rolling on the ground.

[MSG$00675D,53]
Imari "You're so lame. What happened to all that bluster?"

[MSG$0067AC,61]
Imari stands there brushing off her hands.

[MSG$006879,17]
Inoue "..."

[MSG$0068A4,75]
Inoue is staring in disbelief at the two guys on the ground.

[MSG$0068FC,21]
Inoue "What the hell..."

[MSG$00692B,37]
Imari "Now there's only you..."

[MSG$00696A,32]
Imari "What's it gonna be? Do you want to take me on?"

[MSG$0069A4,33]
Imari is confident as she asks Inoue this.

[MSG$0069CA,35]
Clearly, their fortunes have been reversed.

[MSG$0069FA,45]
Inoue "Damn right I do! I'm not backing down now!"

[MSG$006A41,44]
Inoue "Hey, how long are you gonna stay down? Help me out!"

[MSG$006ADC,57]
The first thug struggles to his feet at Inoue's words.

[MSG$006B1A,55]
They signal to each other with their eyes, and turn on Imari as one.

[MSG$006B5E,30]
Inoue "Take this, you!"

[MSG$006BE7,43]
Even though it's 2 on 1, Imari stays calm as she makes her move.

[MSG$006C1F,84]
First she sets herself for the first guy's attack, and deflects his fist. Then she blocks the

[MSG$006C78,51]
|other guy's kick--from behind her-- from the knee.

[MSG$006CB8,43]
The sound of physical contact reverberates across the rooftop.

[MSG$006CF0,35]
Imari "That's really low, you know...2 guys against 1 girl."

[MSG$006D2D,65]
Having dodged their attacks, Imari falls back, still in position.

[MSG$006D7B,50]
Inoue "This isn't about being low or fair. All that matters is that we win."

[MSG$006DC7,55]
With that, they rush her again.

[MSG$006E0B,19]
Imari "Oh?"

[MSG$006E38,45]
That's all Imari says as she swiftly braces herself.

[MSG$006E72,41]
The two guys are rushing her from the front and from behind.

[MSG$006EA0,63]
Imari sets herself to take on the frontal assault while keeping her eyes on the attacker behind her.

[MSG$006EEC,23]
The guy behind her makes his move first.

[MSG$006F10,84]
Closing the gap between them in an instant, he feints a jab, then unleashes a full-on punch towards

[MSG$006F69,23]
|Imari's face,

[MSG$006F8D,86]
Without batting an eyelid, Imari deflects the punch with one arm, then as the guy lunges to attack,

[MSG$006FE8,63]
she delivers a blow to his neck putting all her weight behind it,

[MSG$0070CD,48]
It's a knockout punch. Gagging, the thug goes down.

[MSG$007157,45]
But Imari has no time to rest, as Inoue makes his move.

[MSG$007191,21]
He's going to blindside her with a kick.

[MSG$0071B3,67]
She senses him coming and quickly turns to face him, but by that time he's already within striking distance.

[MSG$007203,83]
She manages to deflect the kick while off-balance. But Inoue's kick is so well-aimed that

[MSG$00725B,31]
she can't deflect it completely.

[MSG$007287,20]
Imari "Ugh!"

[MSG$0072B5,41]
Imari's face contorts with pain as she absorbs the shock of contact.

[MSG$0072EB,49]
She glares at him and uncharacteristically takes the offensive.

[MSG$007329,21]
She rushes in under his arms.

[MSG$007343,27]
The gap between them closes.

[MSG$00736B,16]
Imari "Hah!"

[MSG$00742D,73]
Lowering her center of gravity, she bends her knees, and catapults herself against Inoue.

[MSG$00747B,21]
There's a dull thud,

[MSG$00749D,94]
Inoue is elbowed in the chest. He gasps for air as he bends his body forward.

[MSG$0075A1,75]
|Imari elbows him, then backhands his face, which is leaning forward.

[MSG$0075F9,65]
The elbowing and the backhand punch are delivered smoothly and with merciless destructive force.

[MSG$00766B,37]
Without a word, Inoue crumples to the ground.

[MSG$007720,41]
Imari "Oh, man, you didn't even challenge me."

[MSG$007763,75]
Imari scoffs at Inoue and puts her hands on her hips. She sighs in a resigned manner.

[MSG$0077B3,53]
She's barely out of breath, even though she took on all those guys.

[MSG$0077F5,55]
I've been watching all this with my mouth hanging open.

[MSG$007839,89]
I never dreamed she had moves like those. I hadn't seen her do kempo in a while, but she's even

[MSG$007897,31]
|more lethal now than she ever was before.

[MSG$0078C3,67]
Right now she looks just like any ordinary girl, but then girls who go through ruthless training are to be feared...

[MSG$007913,37]
Inoue "You bitch...I swear I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$007952,57]
Inoue struggles to his feet with a look of pain on his face.

[MSG$007990,75]
Then he pulls a switchblade out of his pocket, and flicks out the blade with a snap.

[MSG$007A1A,54]
Imari "You mean you can't take on a girl unless you have a weapon like that in your hands?"

[MSG$007A6A,25]
Imari looks disgusted.

[MSG$007A90,20]
Inoue "Shut the hell up!"

[MSG$007ABE,35]
Apparently he can't think up an excuse.

[MSG$007AEE,59]
Inoue "I'm gonna use this on your face so I never have to see it again!"

[MSG$007B43,55]
With an evil smile, he advances towards Imari, waving the knife.

[MSG$007B87,68]
There's cold sweat on his brow. Inoue must really be at the end of his rope now.

[MSG$007BD0,63]
With Imari's unexpected arrival, he and his posse have fallen completely apart.

[MSG$007C1C,53]
But even Imari is unnerved by the sight of the knife.

[MSG$007C56,51]
If Inoue's got a knife, she's definitely at a disadvantage...

[MSG$007C96,15]
Man "Stop right there."

[MSG$007CBF,31]
Just then, there's a voice from the doorway.

[MSG$007D41,29]
We all look towards the voice.

[MSG$007D63,63]
A big, muscular guy is striding towards us.

[MSG$007DA7,33]
From the looks of him, no way is he on our side.

[MSG$007DD5,20]
Inoue "Shinjou!"

[MSG$007E03,37]
Inoue calls out to him.

[MSG$007E35,50]
So this is Shinjou...the leader of this gang here, the guy who runs the school.

[MSG$007E6C,19]
A.K.A. Shinjou the Repeater.

[MSG$007E84,49]
He's a notorious delinquent who rarely shows his face at school.

[MSG$007EC2,41]
Apparently he's in school today...

[MSG$007EF0,57]
He only shows up when he feels like it. I haven't seen him in a while myself.

[MSG$007F36,85]
Rumor has it that his dad's a city councilman, which is why he's escaped expulsion despite his many transgressions.

[MSG$007F98,25]
Shinjou "She really did a number on you guys, huh?"

[MSG$007FCB,49]
Shinjou looks around at the guys on the ground, still moaning in pain.

[MSG$008009,59]
Inoue "That's because...see...we went easy on her because she's a girl, and this is what happened..."

[MSG$00805E,51]
I'm sure it would've happened even if they hadn't ''gone easy on her''...

[MSG$008096,45]
Shinjou slowly turns his gaze towards Imari.

[MSG$0080D0,49]
Shinjou "Little girl, I think you've pushed your luck a little too much."

[MSG$00811B,43]
Shinjou looks down on Imari, his eyes icy, as he says this.

[MSG$008153,57]
Imari "They're the ones who picked the fight, you know."

[MSG$0081A6,37]
Imari looks right back at Shinjou as she flings this retort at him.

[MSG$0081D8,33]
Shinjou "Oh, yeah? Well, sorry about that."

[MSG$008213,25]
Shinjou laughs derisively.

[MSG$008239,61]
Shinjou "To show you just how sorry I am, why don't I take you on next?"

[MSG$008290,37]
So saying, Shinjou starts cracking his knuckles.

[MSG$0082BA,37]
When this guy does it, he sure looks fierce.

[MSG$008342,55]
Imari continues to stare at Shinjou without flinching.

[MSG$008386,33]
Imari "I hear you're a really good fighter."

[MSG$0083C1,83]
Imari's right; I've heard the rumors too. Apparently this Shinjou is a formidable karate master.

[MSG$008419,53]
Judging by the way he's built, I can believe it.

[MSG$00845B,29]
Shinjou "You'll find out if you take me on."

[MSG$0084C4,39]
So saying, Shinjou takes his position, hunching over slightly.

[MSG$0084F0,33]
He holds his elbows against his side, his arms relaxed.

[MSG$008516,31]
It's not a text-book position; it's for streetfighting.

[MSG$008593,41]
In contrast, Imari assumes a text-book position.

[MSG$0085C1,69]
She holds her right arm against her side, her left arm bent at a right-angle so it's perpendicular to her opponent.

[MSG$008613,39]
Karate and shorinji kempo are two totally different animals.

[MSG$008647,61]
In karate, you use force; you attack from top to bottom.

[MSG$008689,55]
You utilize your body weight in karate, so you can wreak maximum havoc.

[MSG$0086CD,55]
Shorinji, on the other hand, involves using your whole body to thrust upward, from bottom to top.

[MSG$008709,87]
You go from bottom to top so you can be sure to hit your opponent's vulnerable points.

[MSG$008765,9]
In this way, even someone without a lot of physical strength can do some serious damage.

[MSG$00877B,59]
In shorinji, there are more moves where you attack after first receiving an attack.

[MSG$0087BB,89]
It's effective so long as there's no real discrepancy in height and weight; but since Shinjou's so much bigger than her, Imari's at a clear disadvantage.

[MSG$008821,45]
This isn't going to be another scuffle with an amateur...

[MSG$00885B,65]
Shinjou "Half-assed kempo, huh? You think you can take me out with sneakyass tactics like that?"

[MSG$0088B6,25]
Imari "You're really confident."

[MSG$0088E9,74]
Shinjou "I have nothing against you, but I do have an image to maintain. Don't hate me, okay?"

[MSG$00894D,57]
Imari "I wouldn't slack off just because I'm a girl...it's for your own safety!"

[MSG$0089A0,25]
Imari waits for Shinjou to make the first move.

[MSG$0089BE,39]
She's sticking to the book...make him make the first move, then switch to attack mode.

[MSG$0089F2,81]
Shinjou lets out a breath, then releases one of his log-like legs towards Imari's frail body.

[MSG$008A50,39]
The kick slices through the air.

[MSG$008A84,37]
Imari jumps to the side to avoid it.

[MSG$008AAE,51]
As if he'd been anticipating that move, Shinjou throws a fist in her direction.

[MSG$008AEE,86]
Imari barely manages to dodge the blow by twisting away.

[MSG$008B49,43]
With her left hand she grabs the fist that ends up in the space she just vacated; puts up her right arm and gets ready to throw him.

[MSG$008B81,86]
To create an opportunity to make the throw, Imari starts to press against Shinjou's chest. But at that moment,

[MSG$008BDC,33]
Shinjou brings up his right knee, in Imari's direction.

[MSG$008C0A,14]
Imari "!!"

[MSG$008C32,71]
Seeing this, Imari lets go of Shinjou's hand, and blocks his knee in front of her.

[MSG$008C7E,35]
Imari's body is rocked from the shock of impact.

[MSG$008CAE,19]
Shinjou sneers.

[MSG$008CC6,47]
Imari is right in front of Shinjou, totally vulnerable.

[MSG$008D02,59]
In that instant, Shinjou unleashes a ferocious kick with his right foot.

[MSG$008D4A,17]
She has no time to dodge.

[MSG$008D60,51]
Imari instantly bends her left arm and left leg, to guard against the attack.

[MSG$008D98,19]
She's going to try to block it.

[MSG$008E51,12]
Whack!

[MSG$008E6A,45]
There's a huge thud, and Imari's body is bent over sharply.

[MSG$008EA4,89]
Shinjou's kick is so brutal that it's able to breach Imari's guard. Imari might've thought she was totally protected,

[MSG$008F02,37]
but in reality she'd done nothing more than to cushion the blow slightly.

[MSG$008F34,20]
Imari "Augh!"

[MSG$008F62,25]
Imari's face contorts in pain.

[MSG$008F80,49]
If she hadn't had her guard up, she could've easily broken a bone or two.

[MSG$008FBE,53]
Imari is wobbling on her feet, but she maintains her stance.

[MSG$008FF8,58]
Her eyes are unfocused. She has my respect for not collapsing.

[MSG$00903F,17]
Shinjou "We're done here."

[MSG$00906A,89]
With these cold words, Shinjou pulls back his fist to strike her in her upper body, now unprotected.

[MSG$009165,14]
Whack!

[MSG$009180,67]
He delivers a merciless blow to Imari's dazed face.

[MSG$0091C8,35]
I can't believe he'd do that do a girl. What a cold bastard...

[MSG$0091F8,21]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$0092AD,12]
Body falls to the ground

[MSG$0092C6,71]
Imari crumples to her knees. Then she falls onto the ground like a puppet whose strings have been cut.

[MSG$009312,55]
Blood is pouring from her nose and mouth.

[MSG$009356,20]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$009384,41]
I shout out her name as she falls to the ground.

[MSG$0093BA,81]
But I don't have what it would take to save her. If she couldn't beat the guy, there's no way I can.

[MSG$009410,54]
If I try to take him on, I could get killed.

[MSG$009453,65]
Shinjou "I thought we'd have some fun, but that was nothing!"

[MSG$0094AE,23]
Inoue "Gotta hand it to you, Shinjou."

[MSG$0094DF,58]
Shinjou "This is the girl who beat you guys up? You oughta be ashamed."

[MSG$009533,34]
Inoue "Sorry. To put you through all this trouble."

[MSG$00956F,28]
Inoue "What should we do with her?"

[MSG$0095A5,33]
Shinjou "Do whatever you want with her."

[MSG$0095E0,37]
So saying, Shinjou leaves the rooftop.

[MSG$009612,62]
Inoue "Okay...you really had your way with us, didn't you?"

[MSG$00966A,76]
Inoue "I bet you were enjoying yourself. So in return, you'd better make us enjoy ourselves!"

[MSG$0096D0,19]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$0096FD,51]
Imari might be unconscious; all she does is groan.

[MSG$00973D,39]
Inoue "Huh! What happened to all your bluster?"

[MSG$00977E,77]
Inoue "We need you to be at full strength now. It's too soon for you to be all wiped out."

[MSG$0097E5,25]
Inoue "Okay, take her away."

[MSG$009818,19]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$009845,39]
The guys behind him pick up Imari.

[MSG$009918,21]
Minase "Stop it."

[MSG$009947,57]
I call out to them, still in pain.

[MSG$00998D,39]
Inoue "Hey, that's right, forgot about you, huh?"

[MSG$0099CE,39]
Inoue comes over to me like he's suddenly remembered my existence.

[MSG$009A02,72]
Inoue "You're the one we called out in the first place, right? But never mind, we'll let this one go."

[MSG$009A64,33]
Minase "But she has nothing to do with it..."

[MSG$009A9F,52]
Inoue "You think we're going to let her get away with humiliating us like this?"

[MSG$009AED,57]
Inoue "We've got to make her pay with her body."

[MSG$009B40,79]
Inoue "It really hurts where she kicked me. She has to massage me there or I won't be able to

[MSG$009B94,17]
|stand the pain."

[MSG$009BBF,89]
Inoue "But hey, we're going to let you go free this time. You've got her to thank. Well, we didn't really care too much

[MSG$009C1D,23]
|about you in the first place..."

[MSG$009C4E,53]
Inoue "So anyway, that's the deal. We're borrowing your girlfriend for a while."

[MSG$009C9D,63]
Inoue "Don't worry, we'll be sure to teach her all about grownup intercourse!"

[MSG$009CF6,53]
With that, Inoue and the others leave, taking Imari with them.

[MSG$009D30,59]
Imari's still dazed as the thugs drag her away.

[MSG$009D9C,12]
Door opening

[MSG$009DB5,19]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$009DE2,53]
I'm standing all alone on the roof, in my own daze.

[MSG$009E24,35]
I'm still aching in several places.

[MSG$009E4C,45]
But that doesn't mean I can just wait around until I'm better.

[MSG$009E86,74]
It won't do any good to tell the professors...the faculty doesn't stand a chance against Shinjou either.

[MSG$009ED5,31]
I've got to do something on my own...

[MSG$009F01,41]
And if I don't hurry, something bad will happen to Imari...

[MSG$009F37,61]
I try to endure the pain as I get up, and wobble over to the door.

[MSG$009F81,16]
April 24 - Classroom

[MSG$00A069,39]
Minase "Saeki! Give me back that book right now!"

[MSG$00A0AA,41]
Saeki "Hold on, will you? I'll return it when school lets out."

[MSG$00A0ED,48]
Minase "Don't gimme that. Just hand it over now. That was the deal!"

[MSG$00A137,19]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$00A164,19]
Saeki 'All right, then."

[MSG$00A191,79]
Saeki starts rummaging around in her bag, then takes out the book, wrapped in a white cloth.

[MSG$00A1ED,17]
Saeki "Here..."

[MSG$00A218,29]
Minase "As long as I've got this..."

[MSG$00A24F,71]
I snatch it away from Saeki and rush out of the room.

[MSG$00A2A3,28]
April 24 - Imari Captured

[MSG$00A33E,39]
Minase "Where the hell did they take her?"

[MSG$00A37F,57]
I run down the hall, trying to figure out where they could've gone.

[MSG$00A3C5,29]
Where would they most likely to have gone?

[MSG$00A3E7,67]
I've often seen them behind the school, but there's no place for them to hide a girl.

[MSG$00A437,84]
Even so, it's unlikely that they left the school grounds. They couldn't just drag Imari around, it would be too much of a burden.

[MSG$00A498,39]
My best bet is probably the gym storage room...

[MSG$00A4C4,80]
Once they're inside nobody will know they're in there. It's ideal for what they have in mind.

[MSG$00A521,81]
Clutching the cloth-wrapped book in my arms, I run faster towards the storage room.

[MSG$00A57F,10]
Door opening

[MSG$00A5C8,16]
Takashiro "Oh!"

[MSG$00A5F2,16]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00A6B5,22]
Slam!

[MSG$00A6D8,16]
Takashiro "Augh!"

[MSG$00A726,10]
Crash!

[MSG$00A73D,73]
Takashiro suddenly emerges from a classroom, and I can't avoid colliding with her.

[MSG$00A793,80]
We both fall to the floor. She drops her art books and attendance book.

[MSG$00A7E8,69]
At the same time, I lose my grip on the cloth-wrapped book.

[MSG$00A83A,25]
Takashiro "Ouch..."

[MSG$00A86D,67]
She gets up unsteadily, rubbing her behind.

[MSG$00A8EF,35]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. Are you all right?"

[MSG$00A92C,46]
Minase "Ouch! You shouldn't have come out so suddenly..."

[MSG$00A974,37]
I get up, too, rubbing my bruised hip.

[MSG$00A99E,57]
My body is screaming in pain. First the beating and now this...

[MSG$00A9E4,79]
Takashiro "No, you shouldn't have been running in the halls. Didn't they teach you that back in

[MSG$00AA38,10]
|high school?"

[MSG$00AA5C,65]
So saying, Takashiro starts picking up the chalk that's scattered across the floor.

[MSG$00AAA2,39]
It's all in pieces from the fall.

[MSG$00AAD6,59]
Takashiro "Oh, my...I'm going to have to get some new chalk."

[MSG$00AB2B,51]
I hastily reach for the book I dropped on the floor.

[MSG$00AB6B,22]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00AB9B,63]
I look over at the book and stare.

[MSG$00ABDF,35]
Takashiro looks over, too, ready to help me.

[MSG$00AC0F,18]
Takashiro "What?"

[MSG$00AC3B,45]
She sees the cover of the book, now exposed, and freezes.

[MSG$00AC75,69]
The white cloth has come off, baring the book inside.

[MSG$00ACC7,49]
But it's not the Book of Magic.

[MSG$00ACFD,41]
No way in hell is that the Book of Magic...

[MSG$00AD33,33]
Girl "What's that? Jeez!"

[MSG$00AD6F,85]
Several girls pass by and see what's on the floor. Their comments are cold.

[MSG$00ADD1,47]
Instead of the Book of Magic, the white cloth had been wrapped around uncensored porn books.

[MSG$00AE05,47]
There's everything from S&M to animal fornication...

[MSG$00AE41,83]
Some of them are open, and you can see women with huge boobs in the midst of a dump.

[MSG$00AE99,47]
Of course, it's not censored in any way.

[MSG$00AED5,32]
Holy crap!

[MSG$00AF02,47]
I stand there looking down at the books in a daze.

[MSG$00AF3E,47]
Takashiro "Minase...you're a maniac, aren't you?"

[MSG$00AF87,87]
Takashiro "I can't tell you not to read those things, but I don't approve of you bringing them to school."

[MSG$00AFF8,35]
Takashiro tells me this with a wry smile.

[MSG$00B028,19]
Jeez...

[MSG$00B048,67]
I'm so confused that I can't even get a grip on what's happening.

[MSG$00B098,62]
Okay, so I lent the Book of Magic to Saeki. Then I got her to return it.

[MSG$00B0DB,29]
And this is what I got...

[MSG$00B105,48]
There's no way this is my fault. It's got to be Saeki.

[MSG$00B142,51]
There's also no way that Saeki made a mistake.

[MSG$00B17A,51]
Even if she did put in the wrong book, she wouldn't use these particular ones.

[MSG$00B1BA,21]
Saeki set me up...

[MSG$00B1D4,47]
That bitch...she never had any intention of returning the book to me.

[MSG$00B210,23]
Minase "That bitch..."

[MSG$00B241,68]
But I don't have time for this. I have no time to lose!

[MSG$00B28A,37]
I've got to do something about Imari before anything else.

[MSG$00B2BC,95]
If Saeki is indeed behind this, she would've known I'd find out. She probably left the classroom long ago...

[MSG$00B328,47]
It's Saeki, after all. She's never gonna give up that book.

[MSG$00B35C,78]
I can't depend on the book anymore. I've got to save Imari on my own...

[MSG$00B3B7,22]
Takashiro "Here."

[MSG$00B3E8,61]
Takashiro gathers up the porn books, wraps them up in the cloth and hands them to me.

[MSG$00B432,53]
Maybe she can help me.

[MSG$00B46C,37]
She did say she'd help me if something happened...

[MSG$00B49E,43]
I'm grasping at straws, but I have no choice.

[MSG$00B4D6,40]
Minase "Ms. Takashiro, I need your help!"

[MSG$00B518,30]
Takashiro "What? What do you mean?"

[MSG$00B550,45]
Minase "Inoue and his thugs dragged Imari away..."

[MSG$00B597,44]
Takashiro "They took Imari? Inoue, that troublemaker?"

[MSG$00B5DD,83]
Minase "That's right. She's in danger. Those jerks took her away so they could do something terrible to her..."

[MSG$00B64A,45]
I give her the short version, hoping she'll help me out.

[MSG$00B684,33]
Takashiro "All right, I think I understand what happened."

[MSG$00B6BF,60]
Takashiro "Leave it to me. I'll teach those hoodlums a lesson."

[MSG$00B715,45]
She thumps herself on the chest for emphasis.

[MSG$00B747,75]
Other professors would probably opt to look the other way, but apparently she's not like other teachers.

[MSG$00B79F,85]
Still, Inoue and his gang aren't the kind of guys who can be stopped by a mere teacher. I don't know if Takashiro's

[MSG$00B7F9,43]
|aware of this or not, but I have no choice but to put my faith in her.

[MSG$00B831,24]
Takashiro "So, where are they?"

[MSG$00B863,43]
Minase "Probably in the storage room in the gym."

[MSG$00B8A8,48]
Takashiro "Then we'd better hurry before it's too late."

[MSG$00B8F2,39]
So saying, she quickly heads towards the gym.

[MSG$00B91E,29]
I follow her...

[MSG$00B9C4,27]
Takashiro and I enter the gym...

[MSG$00B9EC,79]
Afternoon classes have already started, but the gym is empty.

[MSG$00BA40,74]
It looks like there aren't going to be any P.E. classes today. Perfect for Inoue and his gang.

[MSG$00BA97,15]
Takashiro "This is it?"

[MSG$00BAC0,25]
We look at the steel door to the storage room.

[MSG$00BADE,42]
We can hear voices coming from inside.

[MSG$00BB0D,35]
No question, Inoue and his gang are in there...

[MSG$00BB3D,23]
Takashiro "Are you ready? Let's go."

[MSG$00BB6E,27]
I nod silently.

[MSG$00BC35,10]
Door opening

[MSG$00BC4C,28]
Inoue "Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$00BC82,57]
As soon as the steel door opens, we can hear Inoue's loud shriek.

[MSG$00BCC8,45]
Just as I'd thought, Inoue and the others are loitering there.

[MSG$00BCFA,37]
And they're standing around Imari.

[MSG$00BDA8,20]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$00BDD6,17]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00BE01,41]
Imari gives me a blank look.

[MSG$00BE37,33]
Apparently nothing's been done to her yet.

[MSG$00BE65,63]
But they've half-undressed her, and you can see the white skin of her chest.

[MSG$00BEA9,65]
Her legs are spread wide open, with her underwear in full view.

[MSG$00BEF7,31]
But something's not right...

[MSG$00BF1B,75]
Imari's eyes are unfocused. and she doesn't seem to be able to hear what we're saying.

[MSG$00BF73,74]
Inoue "You again? I thought you'd learned your lesson. First this girl has to save you,

[MSG$00BFC2,36]
and now it's this woman professor? And you call yourself a man?"

[MSG$00C000,60]
I'll just let him say whatever he wants. The only important thing now is to save Imari.

[MSG$00C049,30]
Minase "What did you do to Imari?"

[MSG$00C081,51]
Inoue "We just smoked up together, so we can feel good."

[MSG$00C0CF,59]
Inoue gives us a glimpse of the cigarette-like object in his hand.

[MSG$00C117,24]
Inoue "You want a drag too?"

[MSG$00C149,81]
He puts it to his lips, inhales deeply, then exhales in our direction.

[MSG$00C19F,69]
The smoke envelopes us, and I can smell its deep, sweet scent.

[MSG$00C1F1,81]
This isn't your normal cigarette...I know a few people on campus who have smokes like these

[MSG$00C247,23]
|too...

[MSG$00C26B,74]
Takashiro "I can't believe you'd smoke that here! You'll be expelled. I hope you're prepared..."

[MSG$00C2CF,33]
Inoue "I'd like to see you try to get me expelled."

[MSG$00C30A,67]
With that, Inoue takes another hit, and exhales the smoke through his nostrils.

[MSG$00C35A,90]
Inoue knows. Even if a professor were to squeal on him, it would be nothing for him to get it covered up.

[MSG$00C3B9,47]
And surely Takashiro knows that only too well...

[MSG$00C3F5,40]
Takashiro "You let Ms. Imari go this minute!"

[MSG$00C437,71]
Inoue "Well, if you take her place, I'll be happy to let her go."

[MSG$00C498,39]
Inoue "I enjoy doing older women once in a while."

[MSG$00C4D9,24]
Takashiro "How dare you!"

[MSG$00C50B,66]
Inoue "Don't get mad, teach. Anyway, this bitch seems to like the stuff."

[MSG$00C567,41]
He leers when he says this.

[MSG$00C59D,22]
Takashiro "Stop it!"

[MSG$00C5CD,61]
Ignoring her, Inoue brings the joint closer and closer to Imari's mouth.

[MSG$00C6A0,59]
Imari tries to fight it, but he forces it into her mouth.

[MSG$00C6E0,33]
Next he pinches Imari's nose.

[MSG$00C70E,77]
Unable to breathe, Imari begins to struggle. Finally she's forces to inhale the smoke.

[MSG$00C768,27]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00C79D,60]
Imari "(gagging)"

[MSG$00C7F3,37]
Imari begins to choke as her lungs fill with smoke.

[MSG$00C825,25]
Inoue "(snickering)"

[MSG$00C858,25]
Minase "Goddamn you!"

[MSG$00C88B,23]
I'm shaking with rage.

[MSG$00C8AF,58]
Inoue "What is it, Minase? Are you mad? Ha!"

[MSG$00C903,56]
Inoue "If you got a problem with this, just bring it. I'll take you on any time."

[MSG$00C955,86]
Sneering, Inoue tries to bait me. But I can't do anything but ball up my fists.

[MSG$00C9B8,38]
Takashiro "Don't worry, I'll take care of this."

[MSG$00C9F8,37]
Takashiro speaks to me as I tremble with anger.

[MSG$00CA2A,35]
Imari "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$00CA67,71]
Imari's eyes look even more drowsy than before. She's breathing heavily.

[MSG$00CABB,36]
Inoue "Is she getting a buzz now?"

[MSG$00CB72,84]
With that, Inoue sticks his hand between Imari's legs, spread wide open. His fingers

[MSG$00CBCB,27]
|trace her crevice, rubbing her up and down.

[MSG$00CBF3,81]
The two thugs behind him watch this, leering as they begin to massage Imari's breasts.

[MSG$00CC51,14]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$00CC6C,55]
Takashiro "Stop that right now! What do you think you're doing, in front of us?"

[MSG$00CCBD,43]
Inoue "Ha! You got a problem with this?"

[MSG$00CD02,81]
Inoue "Want me to do the same to you, Prof? Anyway, this little bitch seems to like it."

[MSG$00CD6D,39]
Imari "Mmm...mmm...ahhh..."

[MSG$00CDAE,76]
Imari is writhing with a look of confusion on her face as Inoue's fingers continue to

[MSG$00CDFF,9]
|stimulate her.

[MSG$00CE15,49]
It might be because she's been drugged, but Imari's getting aroused even in the state she's in.

[MSG$00CE4B,43]
There's definitely a mature woman inside her...

[MSG$00CE83,34]
Inoue "Just look. She's getting off!"

[MSG$00CEBF,84]
Inoue gets carried away and shoves his fingers inside. He begins to rub her up

[MSG$00CF18,45]
|in the sensitive area of her vulva, which is discernible even through her panties.

[MSG$00CF52,36]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..ahhhh!"

[MSG$00CF90,76]
At last Inoue removes his hand from between Imari's legs. There's a small stain on

[MSG$00CFE1,9]
|her panties...

[MSG$00CFF7,59]
Inoue starts sniffing the juice on his fingers.

[MSG$00D03F,40]
Inoue "What a nasty smell. Hahaha!"

[MSG$00D081,32]
Takashiro "You'd better stop it right now!"

[MSG$00D0BB,52]
Takashiro "If you go any further, you'll be sorry!"

[MSG$00D109,64]
Inoue "Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it, huh, Prof?"

[MSG$00D163,58]
Inoue "You're nothing but an art professor...Better not get out of line or I'll make you sorry!"

[MSG$00D256,33]
Takashiro "You're not going to listen, are you?"

[MSG$00D291,39]
Takashiro "Well, in that case I'll have to resort to other measures."

[MSG$00D2D2,47]
With that, Takashiro puts her hand in her pocket.

[MSG$00D30E,14]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$00D329,83]
I glance over at Takashiro's pocket. I can see her white hand gripping

[MSG$00D381,35]
|some kind of black box.

[MSG$00D3A9,30]
What's she going to do?

[MSG$00D3D4,43]
Takashiro advances, first one step, then another.

[MSG$00D40C,45]
Inoue "Hey, let's be gentle with the professor, guys."

[MSG$00D4B7,61]
So saying, one of the thugs advances with a leer on his face.

[MSG$00D4F9,79]
He puts his hand to his hip and withdraws a retractable police baton from a pouch attached to his belt.

[MSG$00D555,16]
Snap!

[MSG$00D572,63]
He flings it outward, and the baton snaps out with a ringing sound. Open, it's three times as long.

[MSG$00D5BE,53]
Inoue "What are you gonna do now, teach? Why don't we call your bluff?"

[MSG$00D60D,15]
Inoue "Get her!"

[MSG$00D636,31]
At Inoue's signal, the thug raises the baton.

[MSG$00D662,10]
Whip!

[MSG$00D679,49]
The metal stick is brought down hard, slicing through the air.

[MSG$00D745,16]
Whack!

[MSG$00D80B,18]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$00D85B,37]
But it's the thug who ends up screaming in pain.

[MSG$00D88D,18]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00D8B9,43]
The thug jumps away from Takashiro as if he's been repelled somehow.

[MSG$00D8F1,10]
Thump!

[MSG$00D908,53]
All 4 of his limbs are rigid, and he rolls around on the floor, convulsing.

[MSG$00D942,29]
I can see the whites of his eyes...

[MSG$00D9E8,38]
Takashiro "Oh, did that sting too much?"

[MSG$00DA28,57]
Takashiro addresses the thug on the floor with a mischievous smile.

[MSG$00DA6E,45]
There's a black, nondescript object in her hand.

[MSG$00DAA0,64]
It's a stun gun...and judging by the state the thug's in, it must be pretty high-voltage.

[MSG$00DB66,20]
Crackle, crackle, crackle!

[MSG$00DB87,89]
Takashiro snaps on the switch. There's a whirring sound, and a bluish light emanates from the tip of stun gun.

[MSG$00DBED,38]
Takashiro "Who wants to get punished next?"

[MSG$00DC2D,62]
Inoue "What the hell! You're a professor, and you carry around a goddamn stun gun?"

[MSG$00DC85,43]
Takashiro "A lady has to protect herself, you know..."

[MSG$00DCCA,17]
Inoue "Grrr!"

[MSG$00DCF5,52]
Inoue "Hey! Somebody shut this psycho professor up!"

[MSG$00DD43,43]
But no one has the courage to go near her...

[MSG$00DD7B,29]
Takashiro "What a wimp..."

[MSG$00DDB2,44]
Takashiro "Can't you take me on yourself, Inoue?"

[MSG$00DDF8,21]
Inoue "What did you say?"

[MSG$00DE27,46]
Takashiro "What's it going to be? If you're not going to make a move, shall I?"

[MSG$00DE6F,53]
With that, Takashiro flicks on the switch.

[MSG$00DEB1,20]
Crackle, crackle, crackle...

[MSG$00DED2,45]
Inoue trembles at the ominous sound of the stun gun.

[MSG$00DF0C,31]
Inoue "I...I've got a weak heart, see..."

[MSG$00DF45,81]
Inoue stares at the bluish-white light as he makes this lame excuse, a weak smile on his face.

[MSG$00DF9B,39]
His legs are audibly shaking.

[MSG$00E06E,22]
Takashiro "No one's going to make a move?"

[MSG$00E09E,37]
Takashiro "Then I guess that means we win."

[MSG$00E0DD,54]
Takashiro "All right, Minase. Take Imari to the campus infirmary, will you?"

[MSG$00E12D,63]
Takashiro "I'm going to stay behind and teach these degenerates a lesson."

[MSG$00E186,89]
I nod my head, fix Imari's clothing, and carry her limp body out of the storage room.

[MSG$00E270,81]
Takashiro "Now then! You know what you have coming, don't you? I'm going to give you the punishment of your lives!"

[MSG$00E2DB,45]
I could hear these words from inside the storage room.

[MSG$00E32A,16]
Whack!

[MSG$00E347,35]
Thug A "Augh!"

[MSG$00E399,16]
Whack!

[MSG$00E3B6,35]
Thug B "Augh!"

[MSG$00E3F3,63]
Their shrieks of agony echo around the silent gym...

[MSG$00E4C6,47]
I hurry back to my classroom and rush toward my seat.

[MSG$00E4FA,55]
I open my bag, and take out the book, wrapped in a white cloth.

[MSG$00E53E,29]
Minase "As long as I've got this..."

[MSG$00E575,43]
Clutching the book, I leave the classroom again.

[MSG$00E5AD,28]
April 24 - Imari Captured

[MSG$00E648,39]
Minase "Where the hell did they take her?"

[MSG$00E689,57]
I run down the hall, trying to figure out where they could've gone.

[MSG$00E6CF,29]
Where would they most likely to have gone?

[MSG$00E6F1,67]
I've often seen them behind the school, but there's no place for them to hide a girl.

[MSG$00E741,84]
Even so, it's unlikely that they left the school grounds. They couldn't just drag Imari around, it would be too much of a burden.

[MSG$00E7A2,39]
My best bet is probably the gym storage room...

[MSG$00E7CE,80]
Once they're inside nobody will know they're in there. It's ideal for what they have in mind.

[MSG$00E82B,81]
Clutching the cloth-wrapped book in my arms, I run faster towards the storage room.

[MSG$00E889,10]
(Door opening)

[MSG$00E8D2,16]
Takashiro "Oh!"

[MSG$00E8FC,16]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$00E9BF,28]
Slam!!

[MSG$00E9E8,16]
Takashiro "Augh!"

[MSG$00EA36,10]
Crash!

[MSG$00EA4D,71]
Takashiro suddenly emerges from a classroom, and I can't avoid colliding into her.

[MSG$00EAA1,80]
We both fall to the floor. She drops her art books and attendance book.

[MSG$00EAF6,69]
At the same time, I lose my grip on the cloth-wrapped book.

[MSG$00EB48,25]
Takashiro "Ouch..."

[MSG$00EB7B,67]
She gets up unsteadily, rubbing her behind.

[MSG$00EBFD,35]
Takashiro "Oh, it's you, Minase. Are you all right?"

[MSG$00EC3A,46]
Minase "Ouch! You shouldn't have come out so suddenly..."

[MSG$00EC82,37]
I get up, too, rubbing my bruised hip.

[MSG$00ECAC,57]
My body is screaming in pain. First the beating and now this...

[MSG$00ECF2,79]
Takashiro "No, you shouldn't have been running in the halls. Didn't they teach you that in

[MSG$00ED46,10]
|back in high school?"

[MSG$00ED6A,65]
So saying, Takashiro starts picking up the chalk that's scattered across the floor.

[MSG$00EDB0,39]
It's all in pieces from the fall.

[MSG$00EDE4,59]
Takashiro "Oh, my...I'm going to have to get some new chalk."

[MSG$00EE39,51]
I hastily reach for the book I dropped on the floor.

[MSG$00EE71,33]
I definitely don't want Takashiro to see what's inside.

[MSG$00EE9F,84]
Out of the corner of my eye, I watch Takashiro frantically picking up the broken bits of chalk,

[MSG$00EEF8,35]
as I quickly scoop up the cloth-wrapped book a few feet away.

[MSG$00EF28,63]
The cloth has come undone from the shock of the fall, and you can see the book inside.

[MSG$00EF6C,43]
I quickly cover it up again with the cloth and pick it up.

[MSG$00EFA4,34]
Takashiro "Well...finally picked them all up."

[MSG$00EFE0,53]
Takashiro's finally done putting the chalk back into its box and looks up at me.

[MSG$00F022,31]
Takashiro "Watch where you're going next time."

[MSG$00F05B,55]
Takashiro brushes the dust off her clothes.

[MSG$00F09F,72]
I don't have time for this. I have no time to lose!

[MSG$00F0F4,40]
Minase "See you later. I'm in a hurry..."

[MSG$00F136,61]
Takashiro "Excuse me, didn't I just tell you not to run in the halls?"

[MSG$00F18D,55]
Ignoring Takashiro, I race down the hall.

[MSG$00F24D,19]
I enter the gym.

[MSG$00F26D,79]
Afternoon classes have already started, but the gym is empty.

[MSG$00F2C1,74]
It looks like there aren't going to be any P.E. classes today. Perfect for Inoue and his gang.

[MSG$00F318,45]
Minase "I'll bet a million dollars Inoue and his gang are here..."

[MSG$00F35F,39]
I'm convinced of this as I look at the steel door of the storage room.

[MSG$00F393,44]
I can hear voices coming from inside...

[MSG$00F3C4,15]
There's no question...

[MSG$00F3E0,57]
I slowly unwrap the cloth from the book in my hands.

[MSG$00F426,61]
Minase "I don't care if you're a god or a demon, just help me out..."

[MSG$00F47D,41]
Praying silently, I open the book and flip through the pages.

[MSG$00F4B3,17]
I don't have much time.

[MSG$00F4C9,56]
It's got to have an instant effect. So there aren't a lot of spells I can choose from.

[MSG$00F50E,55]
Since I have neither the tools nor the time, I'll have to go with a charm...

[MSG$00F54A,33]
I already know how effective those can be.

[MSG$00F570,39]
I just hope it will work out this time, too...

[MSG$00F5A4,16]
Flip, flip, flip...

[MSG$00F5C1,67]
I flip through page after page of pentacle drawings, in search of the right spell.

[MSG$00F609,63]
Needless to say, I'll be playing this one by ear, so I have no idea how powerful it will be.

[MSG$00F655,67]
I brush away such misgivings, and pick out one I think will be appropriate.

[MSG$00F69D,83]
I take a pen from my uniform pocket, remove the cap and place it against my palm.

[MSG$00F6FD,65]
Minase "The Lord is on my side, and on the day of his great anger he shall smite all kings..."

[MSG$00F758,65]
I draw a pentacle on my left palm as I whisper these words.

[MSG$00F7A6,87]
When I'm done drawing, I open and close my fist for confirmation. I used an oil-based pen,

[MSG$00F802,29]
so I'm sure it won't rub off that easily.

[MSG$00F82C,33]
But I don't see any changes.

[MSG$00F85A,42]
Minase "Is this really gonna work?"

[MSG$00F89E,68]
The pentacle of power...I have misgivings, but right now I have no choice but to believe in it.

[MSG$00F8E7,67]
I've never had less confidence in an unseen power...

[MSG$00F937,17]
Minase "All right."

[MSG$00F962,82]
I gather up my concentration by clenching my hand with the pentacle drawn on it once more, then reach for the

[MSG$00F9B9,19]
|cold steel door of the storage room.

[MSG$00FA78,10]
(Door opening)

[MSG$00FA8F,28]
Inoue "Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?"

[MSG$00FAC5,57]
As soon as the steel door opens, I can hear Inoue's loud shriek.

[MSG$00FB0B,45]
Just as I'd thought, Inoue and the others are loitering there.

[MSG$00FB3D,41]
And they're standing around Imari.

[MSG$00FBEF,20]
Minase "Imari!"

[MSG$00FC1D,17]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$00FC48,41]
Imari gives me a blank look.

[MSG$00FC7E,33]
Apparently nothing's been done to her yet.

[MSG$00FCAC,63]
But they've half-undressed her, and you can see the white skin of her chest.

[MSG$00FCF0,65]
Her legs are spread wide open, with her underwear in full view.

[MSG$00FD3E,23]
But something's not right...

[MSG$00FD5A,75]
Imari's eyes are unfocused. and she doesn't seem to be able to hear what we're saying.

[MSG$00FDB2,66]
Inoue "You again? Thought you'd learned your lesson. First this girl has to save you, and now it's this? And you call yourself a man?"

[MSG$00FE0E,30]
Minase "What did you do to Imari?"

[MSG$00FE46,51]
Inoue "We just smoked up together, so we can feel good."

[MSG$00FE93,59]
Inoue gives me a glimpse of the cigarette-like object in his hand.

[MSG$00FEDB,24]
Inoue "You want a drag too?"

[MSG$00FF0D,79]
He puts it to his lips, inhales deeply, then exhales in my direction.

[MSG$00FF69,67]
The smoke envelopes us, and I can smell its deep, sweet scent.

[MSG$00FFB9,81]
This isn't your normal cigarette...I know a few people on campus who have smokes like these

[MSG$01000F,23]
|too...

[MSG$010033,32]
Minase "You let Imari go right now!"

[MSG$01006D,55]
Inoue "Are you ordering me around? You watch your mouth, dipshit."

[MSG$0100BE,49]
Inoue "Anyway, this bitch seems to like the stuff."

[MSG$010109,41]
He leers as he says this.

[MSG$01013F,67]
Imari remains in a daze, looking around her with unfocused eyes.

[MSG$010187,43]
Inoue takes another hit, then takes the joint from his mouth.

[MSG$0101BF,20]
Minase "Stop it!"

[MSG$0101ED,65]
Ignoring me, Inoue brings the joint closer and closer to Imari's mouth.

[MSG$0102C4,59]
Imari tries to fight it, but he forces it into her mouth.

[MSG$010304,33]
Next he pinches Imari's nose.

[MSG$010332,77]
Unable to breathe, Imari begins to struggle. Finally she's forced to inhale the smoke.

[MSG$01038C,27]
Imari "Ugh..."

[MSG$0103C1,60]
Imari "(gagging)"

[MSG$010417,37]
Imari begins to choke as her lungs fill with smoke.

[MSG$010449,25]
Inoue "(snickering)"

[MSG$01047C,21]
Minase "Goddamn you!"

[MSG$0104AB,23]
I'm shaking with rage.

[MSG$0104CF,58]
Inoue "What is it, Minase? Are you mad? Ha!"

[MSG$010523,56]
Inoue "If you got a problem with this, just bring it. I'll take you on any time."

[MSG$010575,37]
Sneering, Inoue tries to bait me.

[MSG$0105A7,19]
Minase "Grrr..."

[MSG$0105D4,19]
I clench my fists.

[MSG$0105EC,44]
Can I really take out these jerks with this spell?

[MSG$01061D,53]
If it doesn't work, then both Imari and I will be in for it...

[MSG$01065F,35]
Imari "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01069C,71]
Imari's eyes look even more drowsy than before. She's breathing heavily.

[MSG$0106F0,36]
Inoue "Is she getting a buzz now?"

[MSG$0107A7,84]
With that, Inoue sticks his hand between Imari's legs, spread wide open. His fingers

[MSG$010800,27]
|trace her crevice, rubbing her up and down.

[MSG$010828,81]
The two thugs behind him watch this, leering as they begin to massage Imari's breasts.

[MSG$010886,22]
Minase "What are you doing?!"

[MSG$0108B6,43]
Inoue "Ha! You got a problem with this?"

[MSG$0108FB,49]
Inoue "Anyway, this little bitch seems to like it."

[MSG$010946,39]
Imari "Mmm...mmm...ahhh..."

[MSG$010987,76]
Imari is writhing with a look of confusion on her face as Inoue's fingers continue to

[MSG$0109D8,9]
|stimulate her.

[MSG$0109EE,49]
It might be because she's been drugged, but Imari's getting aroused even in the state she's in.

[MSG$010A24,51]
There's definitely a mature woman inside her...

[MSG$010A64,34]
Inoue "Just look. She's getting off!"

[MSG$010AA0,84]
Inoue gets carried away and shoves his fingers inside. He begins to rub her up

[MSG$010AF9,45]
|in the sensitive area of her vulva, which is discernible even through her panties.

[MSG$010B33,36]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..ahhhh!"

[MSG$010B71,76]
At last Inoue removes his hand from between Imari's legs. There's a small stain on

[MSG$010BC2,9]
|her panties...

[MSG$010BD8,59]
Inoue starts sniffing the juice on his fingers.

[MSG$010C20,40]
Inoue "What a nasty smell. Hahaha!"

[MSG$010C62,70]
Inoue "I guess she likes me a lot better than you, wuss!"

[MSG$010CC2,30]
Minase "Stop it right now!"

[MSG$010CFA,52]
I can't take it anymore. I've got to believe in the power of my spell.

[MSG$010D3B,32]
Inoue "Oooh, I'm so scared. Calm down, will you?"

[MSG$010D75,85]
Inoue "Don't worry, I'll let you screw her after I'm done. Until then, why don't you just

[MSG$010DCF,17]
|sit back and jerk off while you're waiting?"

[MSG$010DFA,51]
Minase "If you go any farther, you'll be sorry!"

[MSG$010E47,53]
Inoue "Oh, yeah? And just what do you think you're gonna do about it, huh?"

[MSG$010E96,78]
Inoue "There's only one of you, shithead. Do you want me to make you crawl all over the floor again?"

[MSG$010EFE,43]
Minase "Don't think it's going to turn out the same way this time..."

[MSG$010F43,47]
I say this, praying inwardly with everything I have that my words will come true.

[MSG$010F7F,29]
Inoue "Interesting..."

[MSG$010FB6,27]
Inoue starts cracking his knuckles.

[MSG$01108B,41]
Inoue "Hey, somebody beat the crap out of this loser."

[MSG$0110CE,61]
At these words, one of the thugs comes towards me slowly with a leer on his face.

[MSG$011110,79]
He puts his hand to his hip and withdraws a retractable police baton from a pouch attached to his belt.

[MSG$01116C,16]
Snap!

[MSG$011189,63]
He flings it outward, and the baton snaps out with a ringing sound. Open, it's three times as long.

[MSG$0111D5,65]
Inoue "What are you gonna do now, Minase? Why don't we call your bluff?"

[MSG$011230,15]
Inoue "Get him!"

[MSG$011259,31]
At Inoue's signal, the thug raises the baton.

[MSG$011285,58]
Damn...if I get hit with that thing, I'm gonna break something for sure.

[MSG$0112CC,10]
Whip!

[MSG$0112E3,49]
The metal stick is brought down hard, slicing through the air.

[MSG$011321,45]
I close my eyes and wildly put up my left hand to protect myself.

[MSG$011353,47]
Just as I think one of my bones is about to be broken...

[MSG$011428,16]
Whip!

[MSG$011445,33]
With a sharp sound, it slams into my hand.

[MSG$011473,18]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$01149F,39]
But it's the thug who shrieks in pain.

[MSG$0114F7,18]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$011523,22]
Clang, clang...

[MSG$011546,41]
I open my eyes and the thug is gripping his hand in pain.

[MSG$011574,63]
The baton has fallen to the ground, where it rolls around.

[MSG$0115C0,37]
My left hand doesn't hurt at all, even though that's where I got hit with the baton.

[MSG$0115EA,55]
I shake my left hand, but nothing's wrong.

[MSG$01162E,35]
Minase "Haha, I'm totally fine."

[MSG$01166B,47]
I stare at my hand in disbelief.

[MSG$0116D9,34]
Inoue "What the...what the hell happened?"

[MSG$011715,39]
Inoue's eyes are about to pop out of his head.

[MSG$011749,41]
The fact is, the baton did strike the palm of my hand.

[MSG$011777,45]
But not only didn't my hand break, it deflected the blow.

[MSG$0117A9,27]
So that's the power of the pentacle...

[MSG$0117D1,21]
Minase "It's working..."

[MSG$011800,36]
I'm convinced now. The spell is working.

[MSG$011829,39]
Now I have nothing to fear from these jerks.

[MSG$01185D,43]
Minase "You had a lot of nerve, roughing me up like that..."

[MSG$0118A2,53]
I walk towards Inoue, cracking my knuckles.

[MSG$0118DC,27]
Our fortunes have been reversed.

[MSG$011904,59]
Inoue "That was just a fluke. Hey, somebody shut him up!"

[MSG$011959,35]
Minase "Just bring it on."

[MSG$011996,71]
I smile confidently, and bait them by waving my hands.

[MSG$0119E2,53]
When they see me do this, they both jump me.

[MSG$011A9D,28]
Minase "Minase Kick!"

[MSG$011AE7,10]
Pow!

[MSG$011AFE,32]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$011B38,28]
Minase "Minase Chop!"

[MSG$011B83,10]
Crack...

[MSG$011B9A,32]
Thug "Augh!"

[MSG$011BD4,83]
I adopt Imari's strategy, taking them on and tossing them to the side over and over...

[MSG$011C34,79]
Even my sloppiest moves are direct hits. And thanks to their lethal force,

[MSG$011C88,43]
I manage to drop them all to the floor one by one.

[MSG$011D5D,27]
Inoue "No...no way..."

[MSG$011D92,67]
I step all over the losers on the floor as I noisily dust off my hands.

[MSG$011DE2,45]
Minase "Okay...you're the only one left."

[MSG$011E29,33]
I stare at Inoue coldly.

[MSG$011E4F,63]
Inoue has been watching all this, and now he smiles at me as though he's about to piss his pants.

[MSG$011E9B,23]
Inoue "Hahaha..."

[MSG$011ECC,66]
Inoue "We're...we're really sorry about what we did to you, Minase. Come on, let's be friends now."

[MSG$011F28,19]
Minase "No way."

[MSG$011F55,47]
Inoue "Hey, don't be like that. We're buddies, aren't we?"

[MSG$011F9E,56]
Inoue "Come on...listen, I'll do anything!"

[MSG$011FF0,19]
Minase "..."

[MSG$012010,39]
I stare at this loser, my eyes cold.

[MSG$01203C,78]
He'll do anything, huh? In that case, why don't I make him pay for everything?

[MSG$0120BF,33]
Minase "You said you'll do anything, right?"

[MSG$0120FA,56]
Inoue "Sure, sure, that's right. Anything you say. You want money? Women?"

[MSG$01214C,39]
Minase "Go run through the school butt-naked."

[MSG$01218D,25]
I say this in a cold voice.

[MSG$0121B3,20]
Inoue "What?"

[MSG$0121E1,34]
Inoue "You think I'd do something like that?"

[MSG$01221D,40]
Minase "Oh, you don't want to? That's okay..."

[MSG$01225F,55]
Minase "But I'm gonna have to break a few of your bones, then..."

[MSG$0122B0,51]
Hearing this, the blood slowly drains out of Inoue's face.

[MSG$0122F0,42]
Inoue "Okay, I'll do it! Please, let me do it!"

[MSG$012334,22]
Minase "You don't want to, though."

[MSG$012364,71]
Inoue "That's not true. I was just thinking it would be great to run around the school naked!"

[MSG$0123C5,21]
Nobody would ever think that...

[MSG$0123E7,33]
Minase "Okay, then, why don't you go?"

[MSG$012447,89]
Hearing my cold words, Inoue gives up and sheds his clothes. When he's stark naked, he runs out of the storage room.

[MSG$0124A5,59]
His huge prick dangles and bobs between his legs...

[MSG$0124ED,31]
Inoue "Ahhhh!"

[MSG$012526,51]
With a loud cry, Inoue races inside the building.

[MSG$012566,43]
Voice "Augh! What's wrong with you?"

[MSG$0125AB,44]
Guy "Shit! Don't come near me, freak!"

[MSG$0125F1,88]
After Inoue disappears inside, I can hear shrieks and yelps from all over the building. The sight of Inoue's naked body is causing an uproar...

[MSG$012669,33]
Minase "You said you'll do anything, right?"

[MSG$0126A4,56]
Inoue "Sure, sure, that's right. Anything you say. You want money? Women?"

[MSG$0126F6,51]
Minase "Okay, then, maybe I'll make you stand in front of the school gate naked."

[MSG$012743,25]
I say this in a cold voice.

[MSG$012769,20]
Inoue "What?"

[MSG$012797,34]
Inoue "You think I'd do something like that?"

[MSG$0127D3,40]
Minase "Oh, you don't want to? That's okay..."

[MSG$012815,55]
Minase "But I'm gonna have to break a few of your bones, then..."

[MSG$012866,51]
Hearing this, the blood slowly drains out of Inoue's face.

[MSG$0128A6,38]
Inoue "Okay, I'll do it! Please, let me do it!"

[MSG$0128E6,22]
Minase "You don't want to, though."

[MSG$012916,82]
Inoue "That's not true. I was just thinking it would be great if I could stand in front of the school gate and expose myself."

[MSG$012982,21]
Nobody would ever think that...

[MSG$0129A4,56]
Minase "In that case, while you're at it, why don't you jerk off, too? In front of everyone?"

[MSG$0129F6,26]
Inoue "You...you little shit!"

[MSG$012A2A,33]
Minase "Oh, I see...you don't want to do it..."

[MSG$012A65,39]
Inoue freezes when he sees my cold gaze.

[MSG$012A99,58]
Inoue "Oh, come on, I was just kidding! I'll jerk off like there's no tomorrow!"

[MSG$012AED,29]
Minase "Okay, then, why don't you go?"

[MSG$012B48,89]
Hearing my cold words, Inoue gives up and sheds his clothes. When he's stark naked, he runs out of the storage room.

[MSG$012BA6,59]
His huge prick dangles and bobs between his legs...

[MSG$012BEE,31]
Inoue "Ahhh!"

[MSG$012C27,47]
I can hear Inoue's brave cry from the storage room window.

[MSG$012C63,53]
Voice "Augh! What does he think he's doing?"

[MSG$012CB3,26]
Voice "Can you believe the size of that thing?"

[MSG$012CE8,42]
Voice "Gross! Something just came out!"

[MSG$012D2D,82]
After Inoue leaves, I hear shrieks and yelps from outside. The sight of Inoue's naked body is causing an uproar...

[MSG$012D8C,21]
Minase "What a moron."

[MSG$012DBC,63]
With that, I walk towards Imari's limp body.

[MSG$012E00,65]
Then I fix her clothes and carry her out of the storage room.

[MSG$012E4E,77]
Imari ended up like this because she tried to save me. So saving her in return

[MSG$012EA0,21]
|is my responsibility...

[MSG$012EC2,22]
April 24 - Medical Treatment

[MSG$012FBD,10]
Door opening

[MSG$012FD4,71]
I carry the limp Imari into the infirmary, supporting her by the shoulder.

[MSG$013028,22]
Click, click, click...

[MSG$01304B,89]
Inside the infirmary, Dr. Kitami is at her desk typing on a laptop.

[MSG$0130E3,14]
Kitami "Well!"

[MSG$01310B,65]
She notices us, quickly closes her laptop and walks over.

[MSG$013151,73]
She's got that sexy vibe as usual as she looks us over. It feels like she's licking us with her gaze.

[MSG$0131A7,26]
Kitami "What happened to you?"

[MSG$0131DB,27]
Minase "Fell down the stairs..."

[MSG$013210,45]
I hand Imari over to her, giving her a random excuse.

[MSG$01324A,22]
Kitami "Both of you?"

[MSG$01327A,51]
Kitami "Really, now...Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Let me treat you."

[MSG$013358,15]
.........

[MSG$0133F0,23]
Minase "Ow! Ow!"

[MSG$013421,54]
Kitami "Come on, sit still. I can't disinfect the wound if you move around like that."

[MSG$013471,37]
I let her disinfect my cut.

[MSG$01349B,33]
It's the scrape I got up on the roof.

[MSG$0134C9,87]
Imari is in bed. I guess she's still in a daze, because as soon as she hits the bed

[MSG$013525,13]
|she falls asleep.

[MSG$01353F,47]
It'll probably be better to let her rest until she gets back to normal.

[MSG$01357B,54]
Kitami "But how come she's in worse shape than you, when you're a guy?"

[MSG$0135CB,32]
Kitami "Did she fight for you?"

[MSG$013606,61]
She talks to me as she tends to my wounds. I grimace in pain.

[MSG$013650,18]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$01367C,45]
Kitami "You can see a lot from this window."

[MSG$0136C3,39]
Kitami glances toward the window.

[MSG$0136F7,65]
True, she probably had a good view of the rooftop from this window...

[MSG$01373D,29]
So she knows everything...

[MSG$013767,71]
Minase "I was getting beaten up, and Imari jumped in to try to save me."

[MSG$0137C8,47]
I confess to Kitami, seeing that there's no sense in covering it up.

[MSG$013804,49]
Kitami "So the knight got rescued by the princess, eh?"

[MSG$01384F,42]
Kitami "And that's why you both ended up like this?"

[MSG$013893,19]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0138B3,56]
Kitami "I see...so the magician isn't really what he's cracked up to be."

[MSG$013905,24]
Minase "Magician...?"

[MSG$013937,57]
Kitami "Everyone's talking about your magic spells. I hear they're extremely effective?"

[MSG$01398A,86]
Delinquent students are always hanging out in the infirmary, she must've heard the rumors

[MSG$0139E5,13]
|from them...

[MSG$0139FF,56]
Kitami "Just like those students from 12 years ago. They were magicians, too..."

[MSG$013A51,44]
Minase "You mean you know about that? What happened 12 years ago?"

[MSG$013A97,70]
Kitami "Yes, of course I do. I was a student here back then."

[MSG$013AF7,11]
I'd never heard that before...

[MSG$013B0F,80]
Kitami "They were the talk of the school, just like you are now. The resurrected coven of witches..."

[MSG$013B79,34]
Minase "And what happened to those students?"

[MSG$013BB5,70]
Kitami "They all died...The rumor was that they'd all been possessed by a demon who killed them."

[MSG$013C15,31]
She says this calmly with a cold look on her face.

[MSG$013C41,61]
Kitami "Look at you, so serious. Don't tell you really believe a story like that?"

[MSG$013C98,27]
Minase "No...no, I don't."

[MSG$013CEC,39]
I look down to escape from Kitami's gaze.

[MSG$013D20,47]
Then I remember something important.

[MSG$013D64,20]
That's right...Saeki!

[MSG$013D85,33]
I'd forgotten all about her thanks to the incident with Inoue.

[MSG$013DAB,59]
I've got to get hold of her, now that I know she swapped the books.

[MSG$013DF3,69]
Everything started going out of whack since I let her get her hands on that book.

[MSG$013E3D,55]
If only I'd had the book on me, I might've been able to get away from Inoue.

[MSG$013E81,77]
I don't know what she's got in mind, but I've got to get that book back from her...

[MSG$013EDB,61]
I've got to get it back before she gets closer to the book's power...

[MSG$013F25,74]
I'm sure she has no rationale. It's too freaky to see her immerse herself in magic.

[MSG$013F74,61]
Once she gets a taste of that book's power, there's no question that she'll abuse it.

[MSG$013FBE,49]
And if I don't have that book, I'll never be able to stop her.

[MSG$013FF4,27]
It's just like 12 years ago...

[MSG$01401C,25]
Kitami "All right, you're set."

[MSG$01404F,49]
With that, Kitami applies a bandage to my wound.

[MSG$01408D,49]
I look at it and slide off my chair.

[MSG$0140CB,83]
I see that afternoon classes have already ended. There's a chance that Saeki

[MSG$014123,17]
|might've already left the school...

[MSG$014141,27]
Minase "I'm going now."

[MSG$014176,35]
Kitami "What? But what about Imari?"

[MSG$0141B3,25]
Minase "I'll be back."

[MSG$0141E6,37]
That's all I say to her as I hurry out of the infirmary.

[MSG$014218,18]
April 24 - After School

[MSG$01430F,10]
Door opening

[MSG$014326,43]
I enter the classroom and grab hold of Murai, who's standing nearby.

[MSG$014390,30]
Minase "Have you seen Saeki?"

[MSG$0143C8,67]
Murai "Saeki? I haven't seen her since lunch...but why?"

[MSG$014426,31]
Just as I thought, she's already escaped...

[MSG$014452,43]
But her bag is still on her desk.

[MSG$01448A,45]
Murai "She's probably in the campus infirmary."

[MSG$0144D1,74]
No way. There was no sign of her in the infirmary. Where the hell did she go?

[MSG$014528,21]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$014557,53]
Murai "Oh, by the way, Minase, I have to talk to you about something..."

[MSG$0145A6,25]
Murai "Hey, are you listening?"

[MSG$014655,41]
Ignoring her, I rush out of the room.

[MSG$01468B,21]
I head straight for the faculty room.

[MSG$0146A5,19]
I have a bad feeling about this...

[MSG$014741,10]
Door opening

[MSG$014758,51]
I open the door and head straight for the key box.

[MSG$0147E9,10]
Click

[MSG$01487C,20]
Minase "It's gone!'

[MSG$0148AA,63]
There's no sign of the key to the Secret Room.

[MSG$0148EE,57]
I look everywhere, but there's no trace of it.

[MSG$014934,56]
Minase "I knew it...Saeki's gone down to the basement."

[MSG$014986,19]
That's got to be it...

[MSG$01499E,52]
Saeki must've gone downstairs to the basement with that book. But why?

[MSG$0149DF,35]
Don't tell me she's going to try out that ritual...

[MSG$014A07,41]
That book's got my notes in it, too.

[MSG$014A3D,48]
No, wait...I haven't finished deciphering that page yet.

[MSG$014A72,63]
Surely even Saeki couldn't manage to decipher it in half a day...

[MSG$014ABE,41]
I have no choice but to go downstairs and find out.

[MSG$014AEC,63]
I don't mind going down there, but I don't like the idea of her taking the book there.

[MSG$014B38,78]
And worst of all, it's Saeki who took it. That's like jumping into a fire with a bomb strapped to your body.

[MSG$014C1D,89]
I stop in front of the door with the ''No Entry'' sign.

[MSG$014C80,86]
I can see a faint light coming through the transom. Someone's definitely gone down those stairs.

[MSG$014CDB,31]
I put my hand on the doorknob.

[MSG$014D07,10]
Click...

[MSG$014D1E,20]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$014D4C,18]
Click, click!

[MSG$014D6B,15]
It's locked.

[MSG$014D87,35]
There's no way this door could be locked.

[MSG$014DAF,64]
Did she lock it from inside? That means Saeki's still down there.

[MSG$014DFC,18]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$014E28,26]
Click, click, click!

[MSG$014E4F,95]
I twist the knob over and over, venting all my frustration on the locked door. Of course,

[MSG$014EB3,21]
that doesn't get me anywhere.

[MSG$014ED5,34]
Kitami "What are you doing down there?"

[MSG$014F11,10]
Flinch...

[MSG$014FAB,33]
Kitami is looking at me, exasperated.

[MSG$014FD9,22]
Kitami "Are you trying to break the door?"

[MSG$015009,73]
Kitami "You leave Imari lying in my office, and I find you in a place like this..."

[MSG$01506C,49]
Hearing her, I quickly take my hand off the doorknob.

[MSG$0150AA,62]
Kitami "That room is forbidden. Students aren't allowed to go down there."

[MSG$015102,34]
Kitami "Or do you have some kind of business down there?"

[MSG$01513E,25]
Minase "Uh, no, not really."

[MSG$015171,53]
Kitami "Don't tell me you had to go down there after hearing my story?"

[MSG$0151C0,21]
Minase "No, that's not it."

[MSG$0151EF,83]
Minase "I just saw some light coming from down there, so I tried to open the door, but it's locked."

[MSG$01525C,35]
I give her the most plausible excuse I can think of.

[MSG$01528C,52]
Kitami "That's strange. This door shouldn't be locked, you know."

[MSG$0152DA,79]
Kitami "Never mind, I'll go down there and check it out. You go back and sit with Imari."

[MSG$015343,17]
Minase "What?"

[MSG$01536E,25]
But that's pointless...

[MSG$015394,84]
Kitami "You two are close, aren't you? Then you should take care of her, and

[MSG$0153ED,16]
walk her home, don't you think?"

[MSG$015417,58]
She looks exasperated. True, I do owe Imari big time...

[MSG$01545E,27]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$015493,25]
Reluctantly, I leave.

[MSG$0154B9,31]
Kitami "Go on, then."

[MSG$0154F2,21]
Kitami "Come on, hurry!"

[MSG$015545,27]
Reluctantly, I leave.

[MSG$015565,67]
I'm anxious about Saeki, but I can't go down there in front of Kitami.

[MSG$0155B5,79]
Besides, as long as the door's locked, I can't do anything but wait for Saeki to come out.

[MSG$015611,45]
I have no choice but to retreat for now...

[MSG$015643,59]
If I can't go down there now, then I might as well just talk to her tomorrow.

[MSG$01568B,105]
Anyway, Saeki might not have gone downstairs, and even if she is down there, she can't possibly perform that ritual without having deciphered it completely.

[MSG$0156F9,39]
If she realizes she can't do it, then I'm sure she'll give it up.

[MSG$01572D,70]
Next time I see her, I'm going to get that book back even if I have to deck her. The damage should still be slight if I act fast...

[MSG$015778,47]
I make my decision and head toward the infirmary to be with Imari.

[MSG$0157B4,16]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$0158B3,10]
The door opens

[MSG$0158CA,29]
I return to the campus infirmary.

[MSG$0158EC,39]
Imari is still asleep.

[MSG$01599C,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$0159E5,53]
Imari is sleeping peacefully. You can hear her light breathing.

[MSG$015A1F,53]
I can't believe she can sleep so deeply after what happened...

[MSG$015A61,46]
Minase "Imari...wake up! We're going home soon..."

[MSG$015AA9,51]
I'm impressed with Imari's ability to sleep as I shake her gently.

[MSG$015AE9,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$015B32,36]
Minase "I said wake up! Or I'm gonna leave you here."

[MSG$015B70,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$015BB9,21]
Minase "..."

[MSG$015BDB,32]
Minase "Wake up! You idiot."

[MSG$015C15,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$015C5E,40]
Minase "Why don't you kiss my ass?"

[MSG$015CA0,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$015CE9,17]
Minase "..."

[MSG$015D07,49]
I'm ragging her mercilessly, but she still shows no signs of waking up.

[MSG$015D3D,25]
That's unusual for Imari.

[MSG$015D63,60]
Who is she to talk, anyway? She's not waking up at all herself!

[MSG$015DAC,17]
Why don't I just...

[MSG$015DEA,36]
Minase "Hey, wake the hell up!"

[MSG$015E28,22]
Thud, thud, thud...

[MSG$015E4B,35]
I punch her breasts.

[MSG$015E7B,45]
They jiggle like punching balls.

[MSG$015EAD,21]
Let's see how effective that was...

[MSG$015ECF,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$015F18,11]
No good.

[MSG$015F30,42]
Minase "Tougher than I thought. I'll have to do something more drastic."

[MSG$015F74,34]
Tickle, tickle, tickle...

[MSG$015FA3,33]
Next, I tickle Imari on her sides.

[MSG$015FD1,47]
Imari "Zzz..zzz..."

[MSG$01601A,17]
This doesn't work either.

[MSG$016038,45]
Minase "Don't be so unreasonable, Take that!"

[MSG$016080,20]
Massaging

[MSG$0160A1,21]
I start massaging her breasts.

[MSG$0160C3,25]
Huh...they're bigger than I thought.

[MSG$0160E1,41]
So she's gotten big without my noticing it.

[MSG$01610F,15]
What the hell.

[MSG$016152,29]
Minase "(snickers)"

[MSG$016189,17]
This is a golden opportunity.

[MSG$01619F,57]
Now I can get back at her for always waking me up so violently.

[MSG$0161E5,78]
I get a magic marker from the desk, remove the cap and bring it closer and closer

[MSG$016238,9]
|to Imari's face...

[MSG$01624E,33]
Minase "Now you'll know how I feel..."

[MSG$016289,40]
Squeak, squeak, squeak...

[MSG$016347,35]
Minase "I think I'll let you off with this."

[MSG$016384,15]
Heh, heh, heh...

[MSG$016398,39]
I can't wait to see Imari's face when she notices.

[MSG$0163CC,24]
Imari "Mmm..."

[MSG$0163FE,57]
I quickly move my hands away from Imari's face as she starts to regain consciousness.

[MSG$01643C,31]
If she finds out what I did now she'll kill me.

[MSG$016468,31]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$0165AE,8]
Getting up

[MSG$0165C3,58]
Imari "What am I doing in bed?"

[MSG$016617,29]
Imari sits up.

[MSG$016641,9]
Whoa!

[MSG$016657,27]
Imari's not wearing anything.

[MSG$016677,21]
Her underwear is dazzling white...

[MSG$016699,62]
Imari "Oh, right, I just remembered! It was that guy named Shinjou..."

[MSG$0166F1,74]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$016755,51]
Imari's trembling from rage as she remembers what went down on the rooftop.

[MSG$016795,53]
Looks like she doesn't remember anything that happened after she lost consciousness.

[MSG$0167CF,59]
I'm glad, because it would complicate things if she remembered what happened in the gym.

[MSG$016817,69]
Imari "Oh, no, look at the time! The club meeting's over by now!"

[MSG$016876,49]
Imari "Huh? What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?"

[MSG$0168C1,49]
Imari notices that I'm staring at her and looks down.

[MSG$0168FF,19]
Minase "That..."

[MSG$01692C,27]
I point to Imari's bra.

[MSG$016954,18]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$016980,21]
Imari "..."

[MSG$0169A2,35]
Imari looks down at her body for the first time.

[MSG$016ADD,68]
Imari "Augh! Don't look at me! Why am I naked?"

[MSG$016B3B,20]
Imari "Don't tell me..."

[MSG$016B69,29]
Imari stares at me.

[MSG$016B8B,35]
As if I'm the culprit.

[MSG$016BBB,33]
Minase "It wasn't me! That's a false accusation!"

[MSG$016BF6,25]
Imari "I don't know about that..."

[MSG$016C29,70]
I'm being wrongly accused. All I did was come back to wake her up. And this is the thanks I get.

[MSG$016C74,57]
Anyway, Kitami didn't have to take off all her clothes...

[MSG$016CBA,55]
Imari "Stop staring at me, already! Close the curtain!"

[MSG$016D0B,12]
Snap!

[MSG$016D24,55]
I close the curtain around her bed.

[MSG$016D68,51]
Imari, clad only in her underwear, and I gaze at each other in the dim light.

[MSG$016DA8,26]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$016DCF,28]
Imari "Get out of here!"

[MSG$016E9A,8]
Thwack!

[MSG$016EAF,18]
Roll, roll, roll...

[MSG$016F4A,63]
She kicks me sharply and I go flying through the curtain and onto the floor.

[MSG$016F96,69]
I was just trying to lift her spirits, and my plan backfired on me.

[MSG$016FE0,41]
But if she's got that much energy, she must be all right.

[MSG$017162,23]
Imari "You saw, didn't you?"

[MSG$017193,19]
Minase "I saw."

[MSG$0171C0,47]
Imari and I walk home together.

[MSG$0171FC,25]
Imari "Pervert..."

[MSG$01722F,64]
Minase "Look, I told you! It was Kitami who undressed you, and what happened was an accident."

[MSG$017289,50]
Imari "Oh, never mind. There's nothing I can do now, since you've already seen me."

[MSG$0172D5,63]
Imari "And besides, it looks like you saved me from those jerks after the fight..."

[MSG$01732F,41]
Why does she have to blame me for everything?

[MSG$017365,63]
Imari "If you buy me some ice cream on the way home, I'll forgive you."

[MSG$0173BE,29]
Imari "A triple, of course."

[MSG$0173F5,95]
She's talking about this ice cream in a shop on the way home; it's 3 layers of mint, vanilla and chocolate.

[MSG$017461,93]
Imari has a weird ritual: she eats one layer a day, taking 3 days to finish the huge carton.

[MSG$0174CB,23]
Minase "Are you serious?"

[MSG$0174FC,59]
Minase "Anyway, it's cold out now. It's not ice cream season!"

[MSG$017551,56]
Imari "It doesn't matter. Connoisseurs eat cold stuff in cold weather, didn't you know that?"

[MSG$0175A3,33]
Imari "Come on, it's not a lot to ask."

[MSG$0175DE,25]
Minase "All right, all right."

[MSG$017611,53]
Exasperated, I check my pockets to see how much change I've got...

[MSG$01764B,23]
This is why women are such a pain in the ass.

[MSG$01768D,39]
Imari "You know what, I just realized something...

[MSG$0176B9,46]
Everyone who passes by seems to be staring at me

[MSG$0176EC,19]
|for some reason..."

[MSG$017719,10]
Whoops...

[MSG$017730,19]
Minase "..."

[MSG$017750,44]
Imari "Is there something funny about me?"

[MSG$017796,26]
Imari "Well? Is there?"

[MSG$0177CA,15]
Yes, there's something extremely weird about her.

[MSG$0177E6,25]
Minase "I don't see anything..."

[MSG$017819,67]
Minase "I bet everyone's staring at you because you're so pretty, Imari."

[MSG$017876,13]
Heh, heh, heh...

[MSG$017888,31]
I say this even though I don't mean it in the least.

[MSG$0178E6,45]
Imari "Really? Do you really think that's it?"

[MSG$01792D,41]
Imari blushes and laughs shyly.

[MSG$01795B,53]
Seeing her blush like that with the drawing on her face makes her look incredibly stupid.

[MSG$01799D,39]
Imari "I see...everyone thinks I'm cute, huh?"

[MSG$0179DE,40]
Imari "Am I really that good-looking?"

[MSG$017A20,67]
So saying, Imari stops to look at her reflection in the window of a parked car.

[MSG$017A68,22]
Moron, don't do that!

[MSG$017A8B,36]
Imari "Hahaha...HUH?"

[MSG$017AFB,32]
Imari "What?"

[MSG$017B35,23]
Imari "..."

[MSG$017B59,51]
Imari sees her reflection and freezes.

[MSG$017B91,19]
Shit, I'm busted.

[MSG$017BB1,67]
Imari "MINASE!"

[MSG$017C0E,26]
Quiver, quiver, quiver...

[MSG$017C35,49]
Imari starts shaking like a malaria patient.

[MSG$017C6B,19]
This is really bad.

[MSG$017C8B,20]
Imari "I'm gonna kill you!"

[MSG$017CB9,20]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$017DDA,10]
Click

[MSG$017DF1,25]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$017E24,37]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$017E56,73]
I'm all beaten up from the torture Imari subjected me to on the street.

[MSG$017EAC,89]
Imari was so carried away by her rage that she used me as a punching bag and went home in a huff.

[MSG$017F18,25]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$017F4B,57]
I reach home as usual, take off my shoes and head to my room.

[MSG$017F91,20]
April 24 - Night/Your Room

[MSG$01803D,63]
I sink down into my chair, exhausted, and open my bag as always.

[MSG$018089,49]
Minase "Oh, that's right, Saeki's got the book."

[MSG$0180D4,53]
There's an empty space inside my bag again today.

[MSG$018116,43]
Minase "I've got to get that book back, no matter what it takes."

[MSG$01815B,45]
Damn that Saeki, what the hell's she thinking, anyway?

[MSG$01818D,49]
Thanks to Saeki, I got into a load of trouble today.

[MSG$0181CB,88]
I start thinking about all the complaints I can make to Saeki tomorrow to get the book back,

[MSG$018228,19]
and flop onto my bed.

[MSG$018248,19]
Minase "(sigh)"

[MSG$018275,82]
All those notes I took so painstakingly are still stuck inside that book. I have absolutely nothing on hand.

[MSG$0182D4,78]
The last few days, I'd been engrossed in that book, and now that it's gone,

[MSG$018327,35]
everything seems so anticlimactic...

[MSG$018357,59]
Now that I think of it, ever since I found that book, it's owned me.

[MSG$01839F,79]
I lie there in a daze. I can feel time going by...

[MSG$018422,65]
After I've had dinner and taken a bath, I go to bed early.

[MSG$018470,49]
Why not just forget about that book for one night and get a good night's sleep...

[MSG$0184A6,41]
Whatever happens tomorrow will happen.

[MSG$018504,12]
..................

[MSG$01851D,8]
............

[MSG$018532,4]
......

[MSG$01854F,39]
I look down to get away from Kitami's gaze.

[MSG$018583,72]
It's not a question of believing...I've seen that basement room. It would be impossible not to believe it.

[MSG$0185D8,11]
That's right...

[MSG$0185E8,59]
I remember that I was planning to go down there again.

[MSG$018638,67]
Now that I've deciphered that ritual from 12 years ago, I'm going down there to have another look.

[MSG$018688,43]
The only clues I have are that room and that book.

[MSG$0186B8,61]
As long as I'm going to use that Book of Magic, the incident from 12 years ago will always stand in my way.

[MSG$018702,63]
It might be dangerous to keep that book unless I find out what happened...

[MSG$018746,53]
I can't even deny the fact that there's a chance I might come to the same end as those others.

[MSG$018788,25]
Kitami "All right, you're set."

[MSG$0187BB,49]
With that, Kitami applies a bandage to my wound.

[MSG$0187F9,49]
I look at it and slide off my chair.

[MSG$018837,76]
I see that afternoon classes have already ended. It might be the perfect timing...

[MSG$018890,25]
Minase "I'm going now."

[MSG$0188C3,35]
Kitami "What? But what about Imari?"

[MSG$018900,25]
Minase "I'll be back."

[MSG$018933,37]
That's all I say to her as I hurry out of the infirmary.

[MSG$018965,18]
April 24 - After School

[MSG$0189F6,10]
The door opens

[MSG$018A8A,81]
Book in hand, I enter the faculty room, and quickly pick out the key to the basement storage room.

[MSG$018AE0,41]
The key's lying right there where I last saw it.

[MSG$018B16,65]
I put it in my pocket, quickly leave the faculty room and head for the 1st floor stairs.

[MSG$018BE0,77]
I make sure nobody's around, then quietly open the door marked ''No Entry.''

[MSG$018CB2,87]
I flick on the switch, turning on the stair lights. As soon as I do, I can make out the dimly lit

[MSG$018D0E,29]
|outline of the stairs in the darkness.

[MSG$018D38,49]
Slowly, I walk down the stairs.

[MSG$018D76,32]
Thump, thump, thump

[MSG$018E1F,53]
When I get to the bottom of the stairs, my way is blocked by a cold steel door.

[MSG$018E59,61]
I take the key from my pocket, stick it in the keyhole and turn.

[MSG$018EA3,15]
Click...

[MSG$018EBF,18]
Creak

[MSG$018EDE,41]
I open the steel door and enter.

[MSG$018F14,18]
April 24 - Basement Room

[MSG$019025,82]
Using the lighter in my pocket, I manage to light a candle in the darkness.

[MSG$01907C,37]
I can now make out the unchanged sight of the altar in the darkness.

[MSG$0190AE,49]
This is where those students summoned a demon for the last time, 12 years ago...

[MSG$0190EC,39]
This place still gives me the creeps.

[MSG$019120,65]
The moldy, cold air, the stains all over the room, and the magic circles...

[MSG$019166,53]
They're all here as if they've been frozen in time...

[MSG$0191F9,53]
I walk toward the center of the room, gazing at the Book of Magic in my hands.

[MSG$01923B,49]
The last ritual that leads those who've read this book to their final destination.

[MSG$019279,62]
The power all magicians dream about. Controlling evil, making it do their bidding.

[MSG$0192BC,53]
Just like King Solomon, long, long ago...

[MSG$0192FE,49]
This room has borne witness to how those people met their ends.

[MSG$01933C,35]
I start investigating the room.

[MSG$019364,87]
Before, I didn't know what to expect, so I was confused. That was why I wasn't able to give the room a good look.

[MSG$0193C8,33]
But I don't really find anything substantial.

[MSG$0193F6,57]
The only thing I do find is that there are seven big bloodstains here.

[MSG$01943C,27]
If I remember correctly, Saeki had said there were 6.

[MSG$01945C,77]
But that can be explained by assuming that Saeki merely got the wrong information.

[MSG$0194B6,85]
My findings are below expectations, and I stand there at a loss in the silent room.

[MSG$0195A1,93]
I decide to try something else and unwrap the book. Flipping through the pages, I find the section about rituals.

[MSG$01960B,47]
So all I have to help me find the truth is this book after all...

[MSG$019647,35]
I kick away the dust from the floor.

[MSG$019677,53]
The dust rises into the air, and I can make out the clear outline of a magic circle.

[MSG$0196B1,47]
I give it a closer look, and I find it's the same as the one in the book.

[MSG$0196ED,59]
Then I pick up the cross-shaped sword lying on the floor.

[MSG$01972D,51]
The letter ''A'' is engraved on the pommel.

[MSG$01976D,65]
I grip it in my hands, and slowly step into the magic circle.

[MSG$019838,71]
I have the sword in one hand, and the book in the other. I try out the ritual at the beginning.

[MSG$01988C,69]
I trace the edge of the white circle on the floor with the point of the sword.

[MSG$0198D6,76]
Of course, I'm only doing this in a casual way. I have no intention of really opening the gate...

[MSG$01992F,45]
Before I realize it, I'm reciting the chant from the book.

[MSG$019969,55]
Minase "O Lord, we are about to fly towards thy power.

[MSG$0199A5,39]
O Lord, we ask that you recognize our work."

[MSG$0199E6,41]
In that moment, I can feel the tension in the air.

[MSG$019A14,21]
I continue to chant.

[MSG$019A36,61]
Minase "That power which we now use is no more than the dust that swirls in the wind.

[MSG$019A78,72]
And we will be visited by an Angel of God. Extinguish the darkness, and pursue the Angel of God for  eternity."

[MSG$019ADA,79]
Minase "Alpha, Omega, Elohi, Elohim, Sabaoth, Elion, Sadai..."

[MSG$019B43,51]
There are no windows in this room, but I feel a wind.

[MSG$019B83,55]
I pay no attention and use the sword to trace the circle clockwise.

[MSG$019BC7,86]
The sound of the blade scratching blends with the sound of my voice reciting the chant,

[MSG$019C22,31]
becoming a strange rhythm that echoes throughout the closed room...

[MSG$019C4E,27]
Forgetting myself, I continue to chant.

[MSG$019C76,47]
Minase "We shall open the book with the Seven Seals.

[MSG$019CAA,47]
We shall see Satan as he falls to earth from heaven in a flash of lightning."

[MSG$019CF3,86]
Minase "You have endowed us with the power to smite dragons, scorpions, and all of your enemies,

[MSG$019D4E,54]
Nothing exists that can put us in harm's way..."

[MSG$019D9E,86]
Minase "Elohi, Elohim, Sabaoth, Elion, Eschiros, Adonai, Jah, Tetragrammaton,

[MSG$019DF9,22]
Sadai!"

[MSG$019E29,55]
Just then, the magic circle begins to glow bluish-white.

[MSG$019E65,47]
I sense this, and continue to chant.

[MSG$019EA1,53]
But I'm about to reach the main part of the chant.

[MSG$019EDB,45]
If I recite any more I won't be able to go back...

[MSG$019F15,53]
I realize this, yet I can't stop myself.

[MSG$019F57,53]
Minase "O living sacrifice, savior of the spirits, thou who shall open the gates of heaven.

[MSG$019F91,61]
Our enemies challenge us in battle, therefore we need thy power and thy aid."

[MSG$019FEA,19]
Voice "Stop right there!"

[MSG$01A017,47]
Just then, I hear a voice shouting at me from the door.

[MSG$01A053,14]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$01A06E,55]
I stop chanting. I snap out of my trance and look to see whose voice it was I just heard.

[MSG$01A13D,26]
Minase "Dr. Kitami?"

[MSG$01A171,45]
Kitami is standing in the doorway.

[MSG$01A1AB,45]
But she was just in the infirmary. How could she be here now?

[MSG$01A1DD,30]
Don't tell me she'd followed me?

[MSG$01A208,47]
Also, now that I think about it, I'm sure that I locked the door.

[MSG$01A23C,36]
So how the hell did she open it?

[MSG$01A26D,32]
Minase "What are you doing here?"

[MSG$01A2A7,43]
Kitami "I came to rescue you, ignorant boy..."

[MSG$01A2EC,48]
Kitami "Don't tell me you were really intending to summon a demon?"

[MSG$01A336,39]
So saying, Kitami walks towards me.

[MSG$01A36A,33]
Kitami "I haven't seen that book in a long time..."

[MSG$01A3A5,59]
She says this as she gazes at the book I'm holding.

[MSG$01A3ED,86]
Kitami "That book is very convenient, you know... It contains many demonic secrets that were said to have been handed down from the Devil..."

[MSG$01A45D,85]
Kitami "The fruit forbidden by God. Those humans from Biblical times ate the forbidden fruit and felt God's wrath.

[MSG$01A4B7,21]
They were cursed and driven from Eden."

[MSG$01A4E6,79]
Kitami "Do you know why? Those who eat that fruit become God's equal. Because God was so fearful and jealous,

[MSG$01A53A,49]
he made it a sin for them to eat it and used that as a pretext to drive them out."

[MSG$01A585,81]
Kitami "In other words, that book is the forbidden fruit of knowledge. And those who partake of this fruit

[MSG$01A5DB,13]
|can become closer in stature to God."

[MSG$01A602,30]
Minase "How do you know that?"

[MSG$01A63A,69]
I'm wary of Kitami's words as I grip the Book of Magic.

[MSG$01A68C,73]
Kitami "Because I practice what's in that book. You tried to use it yourself, didn't you?"

[MSG$01A6EF,77]
Kitami "I'm the only one who witnessed that ritual 12 years ago from start to finish..."

[MSG$01A756,45]
With that, Kitami smiles eerily at me.

[MSG$01A788,81]
The way she puts it, it sounds like she was a member of that coven.

[MSG$01A7E6,42]
Minase "Those people from back then all died, didn't they?"

[MSG$01A82A,50]
Kitami "Yes, they died...It was a total bloodbath in here."

[MSG$01A876,45]
I don't get what she's saying. I stare at her suspiciously.

[MSG$01A8A8,70]
Kitami's just trying to trick me. She's using her words to confuse me.

[MSG$01A8FB,84]
Kitami "Don't look at me like that. Do I look like a ghost to you? I've got two feet, you know."

[MSG$01A969,35]
She gives me a cold smile when she says this.

[MSG$01A999,81]
She said she uses the power, too. If that's the case, then does she know more about this book than I do?

[MSG$01A9EF,91]
Besides that, I can't believe there was someone else at school other than me who knew about this book.

[MSG$01AA57,78]
Minase "So, what kind of business does a witch have with me? Have you come to get this book back?"

[MSG$01AAC0,23]
Kitami "No, that's not it."

[MSG$01AAF1,96]
Kitami "If you want that book, you can have it. But only if you're one of my kind, of course."

[MSG$01AB6B,28]
Minase "What do you mean by that?"

[MSG$01ABA1,27]
Kitami "I've come to invite you."

[MSG$01ABD6,22]
Minase "Invite me?"

[MSG$01AC06,15]
Kitami "That's right."

[MSG$01AC2F,72]
Kitami "You're someone who's been lured by magic, just like I was. I've come to save you."

[MSG$01AC91,41]
Kitami stares right into my eyes as she says this.

[MSG$01ACC7,56]
Kitami "You want to find out the truth. The truth about this world."

[MSG$01AD19,60]
Kitami "To have the same power as a god. To obtain the kind of divine power no human can ever hope to have."

[MSG$01ADA1,68]
Kitami "If you desire it, you can claim it for yourself. Just like I have."

[MSG$01ADFF,39]
With that, Kitami's smile twists her mouth.

[MSG$01AE33,14]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$01AE4E,63]
Kitami "That's right...12 years ago, I acquired that power right here."

[MSG$01AEA7,56]
Kitami "12 years ago, I saw Hell with my own eyes. The Hell of this world."

[MSG$01AEF9,57]
Kitami "And it was while I was in that Hell that I made a contract with the Devil."

[MSG$01AF4C,68]
You mean she acquired the power of the ruler of Hell during that ritual?!

[MSG$01AF9D,23]
But that's impossible...

[MSG$01AFB9,42]
I mean, wasn't it a failed ritual?

[MSG$01AFF0,31]
Kitami "You don't believe me, do you?"

[MSG$01B029,74]
Kitami "But I survived the ritual. I'm the sole survivor of that session in Hell..."

[MSG$01B08D,54]
Kitami "Don't you want to have that power, too? More power than you can imagine?"

[MSG$01B0DD,84]
Kitami "It's the kind of power all magicians dream about. Every living entity will bow before you. If you

[MSG$01B136,23]
|wish it, the entire world..."

[MSG$01B167,84]
Kitami "If you do as I say, I'll show you that dream. Of course, you have nothing to fear."

[MSG$01B1D5,49]
So saying, Kitami bites her lip.

[MSG$01B213,49]
Kitami "If you become my partner, it will take a load off me."

[MSG$01B25E,104]
Kitami "You only have to do as I tell you. That's all you have to do to acquire power and pleasure."

[MSG$01B2E0,99]
Kitami "This is a transaction. You desire...I provide. But you have to satisfy my every desire..."

[MSG$01B35D,68]
Kitami "Just do as I say. Together we can usher in a new millennium."

[MSG$01B3BB,59]
Kitami "Now then...what's it going to be, Minase? I want to hear your answer."

[MSG$01B450,27]
Minase "All right..."

[MSG$01B485,51]
Unable to put up any more resistance, I give in to Kitami.

[MSG$01B4C5,49]
At this point, I might as well fall as far as I can.

[MSG$01B4FB,51]
Even if I try to reject her advances in my mind, my body has another agenda.

[MSG$01B53B,77]
From the moment I was convinced of the book's power, I knew somewhere deep down inside that I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation...

[MSG$01B595,81]
It turns out that I'm just like those students from 12 years ago. I won't be satisfied unless I go all the way.

[MSG$01B5EB,41]
Even if it's the road to hell...

[MSG$01B621,31]
Kitami "I'm glad you said yes."

[MSG$01B65A,60]
Kitami "All right, then, I'm going to teach you everything I know... About the wonders of the Dark Arts."

[MSG$01B6B0,23]
Kitami "Now then, come here."

[MSG$01B6FF,55]
Unsteadily, I fall into her arms, offering no resistance.

[MSG$01B73B,57]
She puts her hand on my neck, and her mouth over mine...

[MSG$01B874,21]
Minase "(gulps)"

[MSG$01B8A3,22]
Slither...slither...

[MSG$01B8C6,49]
Soon, Kitami's long tongue pushes its way between my lips.

[MSG$01B904,17]
Kitami "Mmm..."

[MSG$01B92F,21]
Minase "(Gulping)"

[MSG$01B95E,43]
Having someone else's tongue crawling all over the inside of my mouth...

[MSG$01B98E,29]
It was a strange sensation.

[MSG$01B9B8,49]
I'm unable to resist, so I just let her have her way with me.

[MSG$01B9EE,33]
And soon I'm intoxicated with the sweet sensation...

[MSG$01BA1C,73]
Our tongues are eventually entwined, and our saliva mixes together in our mouths.

[MSG$01BA6A,27]
I suck it greedily.

[MSG$01BA92,47]
We stay that way for a long time, then Kitami finally releases me.

[MSG$01BB47,21]
Minase 'Ah..."

[MSG$01BB76,19]
We pull away from each other.

[MSG$01BB8E,55]
There's a thread of our saliva stretching between us. It falls to the ground.

[MSG$01BBD2,33]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01BC0D,64]
Kitami "Now then, get yourself out of those clothes. Show me all of you!"

[MSG$01BCE0,39]
I let Kitami undress me...

[MSG$01BD14,55]
She tosses my pants, my jacket, and my shorts on the floor.

[MSG$01BD58,33]
Soon I'm stark naked...

[MSG$01BD86,57]
I'm embarrassed that my crotch is plain view, so I cover it with my hand.

[MSG$01BDCC,58]
Kitami "You can't do anything if your hand's there. Come on, out of the way!"

[MSG$01BE99,19]
Minase "Oh!"

[MSG$01BEC6,45]
Kitami pushes my hand away.

[MSG$01BF00,52]
Kitami "Well, now...you have pretty good equipment there."

[MSG$01BF4E,41]
Kitami "And it's already hard from anticipation."

[MSG$01BF91,57]
My prick has been erect since our kissing session just now.

[MSG$01BFD7,31]
Kitami "First of all, I'm going to eat you up."

[MSG$01C010,45]
With that, she pushes her lips against the tip of my prick.

[MSG$01C0C3,65]
My rigid penis gradually disappears inside her mouth.

[MSG$01C111,22]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$01C141,39]
Kitami skillfully manipulates my dick inside her mouth.

[MSG$01C175,11]
She's good...

[MSG$01C18D,63]
She wraps her hot tongue around my penis, sucking hard.

[MSG$01C1D1,43]
From time to time, she stimulates my urethra with her tongue.

[MSG$01C209,81]
The pleasure's so intense I'm ready to melt. I'm in a daze as I let myself get lost in the ecstasy.

[MSG$01C25F,53]
If it means I can get a taste of this, then falling to the Dark Arts isn't so bad...

[MSG$01C31A,34]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$01C349,39]
Kitami grips my balls in her free hand.

[MSG$01C375,55]
While she continues to caress my prick in her mouth, she massages my balls.

[MSG$01C3B9,37]
Minase "(Breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01C3F8,31]
Kitami "Go ahead...let it out."

[MSG$01C431,44]
Kitami "You're not going to be satisfied by coming just once, right?"

[MSG$01C477,47]
Minase "(Breathing heavily) Can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$01C4C0,26]
Kitami "Do you want me to swallow it?"

[MSG$01C514,46]
Minase "Swallow it...hurry up...I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$01C55C,51]
I say this, desperately trying to hold back my urge to ejaculate.

[MSG$01C59C,25]
Kitami "I guess I have no choice."

[MSG$01C64C,59]
Once again she pushes her mouth against my prick and slowly slips it inside.

[MSG$01C694,14]
Slide...

[MSG$01C6AF,24]
Minase "Can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$01C7D3,42]
Throb! Twitch! Throb!

[MSG$01C80A,41]
Minase "Augh! Whoa! Ahhh!"

[MSG$01C84D,53]
As soon as she puts my cock in her mouth I begin to ejaculate relentlessly.

[MSG$01C88F,45]
I'm writhing as I begin to twitch and shoot off.

[MSG$01C8C9,20]
Gulp, gulp...

[MSG$01C8EA,73]
As her mouth fills with the heady-smelling cum, she swallows it down noisily.

[MSG$01C940,32]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$01C96D,45]
The stimulation's so strong I can't stop ejaculating.

[MSG$01C9A7,71]
There's so much cum and I'm shooting off so hard that it starts to overflow from Kitami's mouth, running down her chin.

[MSG$01C9F3,25]
She can't take it and removes my prick from her mouth.

[MSG$01CA92,14]
Splat...

[MSG$01CAAD,29]
Kitami "(gagging)"

[MSG$01CAE4,60]
Kitami "Really! That's too much cum, I can't swallow all that!"

[MSG$01CB3A,83]
With that, Kitami starts to lick away the thick white semen collecting around her mouth.

[MSG$01CB9A,23]
Kitami "You're still shooting off."

[MSG$01CBCB,79]
After popping out from Kitami's mouth, my prick continues to spray cum.

[MSG$01CC27,53]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01CC76,47]
I'm totally wiped out and I fall over in exhaustion.

[MSG$01CCBD,31]
Minase "Can I just...come all over you?"

[MSG$01CCF6,55]
I say this, desperately trying to hold back my urge to ejaculate.

[MSG$01CD3A,25]
Kitami "All right, go ahead."

[MSG$01CD6D,45]
Kitami "Cover me in your juice..."

[MSG$01CDB4,49]
I can't take it anymore, and I start jerking off with my prick in my hands.

[MSG$01CDF2,26]
Rub, rub, rub...

[MSG$01CE19,53]
I'm already stimulated, so it's not long before I'm ready to come.

[MSG$01CE5B,24]
Minase "Can't hold it in!"

[MSG$01CF7F,42]
Throb! Twitch! Throb!

[MSG$01CFB6,41]
Minase "Augh! Whoa! Ahhh!"

[MSG$01CFF9,43]
I spray my cum all over Kitami's body.

[MSG$01D029,63]
I'm twitching and ejaculating at the same time. I'm swooning from the pleasure.

[MSG$01D075,20]
Splat, splat, splat...

[MSG$01D096,55]
My frothy white cum rains down on her face and breasts.

[MSG$01D0D2,39]
She doesn't even try to dodge it.

[MSG$01D106,32]
Glub, glub, glub...

[MSG$01D133,45]
The stimulation's so strong I can't stop ejaculating.

[MSG$01D16D,49]
The cum starts running down her body.

[MSG$01D1A3,47]
Her face is already plastered with the thick juice.

[MSG$01D258,84]
Kitami "That's too much cum. Look at my face, it's all wet and sticky because of you."

[MSG$01D2C6,67]
So saying, she licks away the semen that rolls down her face near her mouth.

[MSG$01D316,23]
Kitami "And you're still coming."

[MSG$01D347,65]
There's still some juice Spurting from the tip of my prick.

[MSG$01D395,53]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$01D3E4,47]
I'm totally wiped out and I fall over in exhaustion.

[MSG$01D49C,43]
Kitami "All right, now I'm going to eat you with my pussy."

[MSG$01D4E1,43]
So saying, Kitami licks her lips.

[MSG$01D519,47]
But my prick is starting to go soft.

[MSG$01D54D,76]
It can't be helped, since I came so hard just now. No way can I do it again so soon...

[MSG$01D5A6,29]
Minase "Let me rest a minute..."

[MSG$01D5DD,48]
Kitami "Don't be such a wuss. We've only gotten started here."

[MSG$01D627,37]
Minase "But I can't do it again so soon."

[MSG$01D666,29]
Kitami "Don't worry, just leave it to me."

[MSG$01D69D,72]
With that, Kitami grabs my prick, fills her mouth with saliva and starts to spit it out

[MSG$01D6EA,21]
on my penis.

[MSG$01D70C,55]
Kitami "O Uvall, Amon, Astaroth..."

[MSG$01D75D,75]
As she whispers, she begins to pump my prick, now glistening with her saliva.

[MSG$01D7B5,30]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$01D7E0,75]
The saliva has a lubricating effect. Her hand slips and slides as she continues to rub me.

[MSG$01D838,73]
As she continues the hand job, my prick gets even harder than before.

[MSG$01D886,61]
The veins are distended, and it's twitching as if I'm about to come.

[MSG$01D8D0,28]
Kitami "Now you can do it, can't you?"

[MSG$01D906,83]
My prick pops erect in her hands. My whole body is tingling.

[MSG$01D966,65]
She sees what's happening, lets go of my penis and rips off her clothes.

[MSG$01DA3D,41]
Kitami's well-built body is exposed before my eyes.

[MSG$01DA73,10]
Gulp...

[MSG$01DA8A,25]
I gulp at the sight.

[MSG$01DAB0,49]
Right in front, right within my reach is Kitami's lewd crotch.

[MSG$01DAE6,57]
My prick goes even more erect as I anticipate thrusting myself inside.

[MSG$01DB2C,29]
Minase "Let...let me put my dick inside."

[MSG$01DB63,33]
I ask her without even thinking about it.

[MSG$01DB91,87]
Kitami "You want to put it in me? You want to put that nasty engorged thing inside me?"

[MSG$01DC02,27]
Minase "Yes, I do..."

[MSG$01DC37,41]
I'm begging her. It's like I'm being manipulated.

[MSG$01DC6D,38]
Kitami "What do you say when you ask someone for a favor?"

[MSG$01DCAD,47]
Minase "Please let me put my dick inside you."

[MSG$01DCF6,47]
I know how lame it must sound, but I beg her in a plaintive tone.

[MSG$01DD2A,76]
Right now all I can think of is penetrating Kitami. I'll do anything if she'll let me.

[MSG$01DD83,19]
Kitami "All right..."

[MSG$01DDB0,39]
Kitami "But first, I want you to lick me down there."

[MSG$01DDF1,41]
I do as she says and lower my head to her crotch.

[MSG$01DE27,10]
Smack...

[MSG$01DE3E,37]
I kiss the sensitive mound of her vulva, and suck it up in my mouth.

[MSG$01DE68,57]
Then I use my tongue to lick at her crevice like a dog.

[MSG$01DEAE,20]
Lick, lick...

[MSG$01DF48,19]
Kitami "Ahhh..."

[MSG$01DF75,39]
Right away her juice starts flowing, and it hits my tongue.

[MSG$01DFA1,53]
I let my tongue run all over her crevice, licking it up.

[MSG$01DFE3,54]
Kitami "Mmm...Put your whole tongue inside. I want you to lick me thoroughly inside, too."

[MSG$01E033,67]
I do as she says, sticking out my tongue and pushing it inside her crevice.

[MSG$01E07B,47]
I push away her labia, and my tongue disappears inside.

[MSG$01E0B7,10]
Lick...

[MSG$01E0CE,62]
I sweep my tongue all over her vagina. At the same time I stimulate her clit with the tip of my nose.

[MSG$01E119,39]
Kitami "That feels great...You're pretty good at this!"

[MSG$01E15A,22]
Glub...glub...

[MSG$01E17D,96]
I continue to eat her out for a long time. Kitami starts breathing heavily as I bury my head in her crotch, totally out of it.

[MSG$01E1EA,29]
Kitami "I'm just about ready now..."

[MSG$01E221,51]
I remove my mouth from her crotch area as if I'm being peeled away.

[MSG$01E259,61]
The area around my mouth is sticky with saliva and Kitami's juice.

[MSG$01E2A3,41]
Kitami "All right, now I'm going to cleanse your body."

[MSG$01E2E6,18]
Minase "...?"

[MSG$01E305,53]
Kitami "You're going to baptized with my Holy Fluid..."

[MSG$01E354,37]
Kitami "Stay still, now. Ahhh!"

[MSG$01E41C,10]
Spurt...

[MSG$01E433,28]
(Spraying)

[MSG$01E45C,57]
Kitami "I hereby baptize this man, Taki Minase, in my name..."

[MSG$01E4AF,28]
Squirt, squirt, squirt!

[MSG$01E4D8,34]
Minase "Whoa! Augh!"

[MSG$01E514,87]
Suddenly a stream of amber-colored fluid sprays out from Kitami's crevice, splattering my face.

[MSG$01E578,35]
Kitami "Come on, drink it. Drink it now!"

[MSG$01E5B5,57]
I raise my face and catch the spray in my mouth.

[MSG$01E5FB,41]
Minase "(gulping and gagging)"

[MSG$01E63E,80]
Kitami "O Almighty Ruler of Hell, you have blessed us with the ability to reproduce endlessly.

[MSG$01E693,72]
Let those who wish to join us be reborn by the grace of this baptismal water,

[MSG$01E6E0,52]
and so that they may become one of your beloved children, grant them now greater knowledge of your teachings."

[MSG$01E72E,52]
Kitami "I ask this in the name of our great rulers, Astaroth, Belzebub,

[MSG$01E767,35]
and Lucifer..."

[MSG$01E81D,20]
Splat...splat...

[MSG$01E83E,38]
Minase "(Coughing and gulping)"

[MSG$01E87E,53]
Finally she's done peeing, and I'm released from my task.

[MSG$01E8B8,55]
I drank so much that it tastes like urine when I burp. I can't stop gagging.

[MSG$01E8FC,46]
Kitami "Well done. Now you're one of us."

[MSG$01E944,49]
Kitami "Okay, now it's my turn to let you inside me."

[MSG$01E98F,45]
With that, she places my prick against her crotch.

[MSG$01E9C9,41]
Kitami "I'm going to give you the ultimate pleasure..."

[MSG$01EA0C,68]
Kitami "It's the kind of pleasure you normally wouldn't get to experience. Don't hold back...get as aroused as you want."

[MSG$01EA6A,53]
With that, Kitami slowly sinks down...

[MSG$01EB30,19]
Kitami "Augh..."

[MSG$01EB5D,14]
Glub, glub, glub

[MSG$01EB78,21]
Minase "Augh..."

[MSG$01EBA7,37]
My prick is skewering Kitami's crotch.

[MSG$01EBD9,90]
The head of my penis shoves through her crevice. I watch it slowly disappear inside her, and a feeling of

[MSG$01EC38,43]
intense pleasure takes over my own crotch until I'm ready to swoon.

[MSG$01EC70,57]
A bigger wave of pleasure than the one I felt when she was giving me head sweeps over my body.

[MSG$01ED3F,40]
Kitami "Well? How does it feel to be inside me?"

[MSG$01ED81,59]
She's looking at me with a lewd smile on her face as I swoon.

[MSG$01EDC1,61]
I look down and see that my prick is inserted up her vagina all the way.

[MSG$01EE0B,29]
Minase "It feels...really good."

[MSG$01EE42,21]
I answer in a groan.

[MSG$01EE64,49]
If I lose focus I'll come.

[MSG$01EE9A,77]
Kitami's vagina seems to have a life of its own. It envelopes my prick, squirming all the while...

[MSG$01EEF4,50]
Kitami "I'm going to move now...keep your head about you."

[MSG$01EF40,53]
With that, Kitami begins to slowly churn up and down.

[MSG$01EF82,26]
Squish...squish...

[MSG$01EFA9,18]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$01EFD5,85]
The second she starts moving, I start convulsing from the stimulation.

[MSG$01F02F,45]
It feels as if my whole body has become one big sexual organ.

[MSG$01F069,41]
Kitami "Well...I've only just gotten started, you know."

[MSG$01F0AC,44]
Squish, squish, squish...

[MSG$01F0E5,61]
Just like she said, it's a pleasure so intense I'm ready to faint.

[MSG$01F127,59]
I feel like my brain's going to melt. I come close to fainting numerous times.

[MSG$01F16F,31]
We lie together on top of the magic circle...

[MSG$01F193,73]
I'm writhing on top of that mysterious diagram. It's like I'm being raped by Kitami.

[MSG$01F1E9,50]
A priest being raped by the devil...that's the perfect description.

[MSG$01F228,86]
I'm lying underneath Kitami, and I have no choice but let her do whatever she wants with me. I can't even move on my own.

[MSG$01F283,39]
If I tried, I'd come in a second.

[MSG$01F2B7,49]
We're both moaning, and the sound of our voices echo across the room like a chant.

[MSG$01F2F5,42]
Kitami "Well? Isn't this the best sex you've ever had?"

[MSG$01F339,51]
Minase "It's the best, all right. I can't hold it in anymore!"

[MSG$01F386,44]
Kitami "You can't come yet. Hold it in!"

[MSG$01F3CC,51]
Minase "But you don't understand...I can't hold it in!"

[MSG$01F419,86]
Kitami "Don't worry. All of your senses are under my control. Even if you want to come, it won't be possible

[MSG$01F474,39]
|unless I want you to."

[MSG$01F4B5,26]
Minase "What are you talking about?"

[MSG$01F4E9,91]
But come to think of it, even though I've had the urge to come, I keep getting the sensation that I'm being forced to hold it in.

[MSG$01F551,67]
And the pleasure keeps ebbing and flowing as well.

[MSG$01F599,54]
All because she's controlling me?

[MSG$01F5DC,83]
Kitami "So? Normally, you'd have come long ago. But I'm stretching it out, making you last a little longer."

[MSG$01F649,40]
Kitami "Pretty stimulating, huh?"

[MSG$01F68B,31]
She pumps her hips as she says this.

[MSG$01F6B7,27]
Desperately I try to endure the stimulation.

[MSG$01F6DF,91]
There's no way for me to relieve myself of this torture-like pleasure unless I come. But since she won't allow me to come,

[MSG$01F73F,25]
I have no choice but to hold back...

[MSG$01F765,25]
But I've already reached my limit.

[MSG$01F783,45]
If I hold it back any longer, I'm going to go crazy.

[MSG$01F7BD,47]
Minase "Let me come now! I'm going crazy!"

[MSG$01F806,25]
Desperately I plead with Kitami.

[MSG$01F824,49]
If she keeps stringing me along like this, I know I'm going to go insane.

[MSG$01F862,89]
It's like I've inhaled a lethal dose of marijuana...This pleasure that I'm unable to control myself

[MSG$01F8C0,45]
|has far exceeded the bounds of rationality...

[MSG$01F8FA,38]
Kitami "So you're almost at your limit?'

[MSG$01F93A,35]
Kitami "All right, then, I'll let you come now."

[MSG$01F977,61]
Kitami "I'll even let you come inside me. Now doesn't that make you happy?"

[MSG$01F9CE,51]
Minase "Makes me really happy...so let me come now!"

[MSG$01FA1B,48]
Kitami "All right. Let it all out at once!"

[MSG$01FA65,51]
With that, Kitami starts pumping her hips even faster.

[MSG$01FA9D,59]
At the same time, my orgasm peaks all at once.

[MSG$01FAE5,42]
Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat!

[MSG$01FB1C,47]
The sound of our bodies knocking against each other echoes across the room.

[MSG$01FB58,92]
Kitami "All right, all right! You want to come, don't you? You want to unload your dirty cum inside me, don't  you?"

[MSG$01FBCE,40]
Minase "I'm gonna come! Augh! I'm coming!"

[MSG$01FC10,59]
Kitami "Come inside me. I want you to let it all out inside my womb!"

[MSG$01FC65,32]
Minase "Ahhhhh!"

[MSG$01FC9F,83]
In that instant, my mind goes blank. I ejaculate so hard inside Kitami that it feels like my prick is going to  burst.

[MSG$01FD78,32]
Throb, throb, throb!

[MSG$01FE1E,54]
Kitami "I can feel you coming. You're coming all over my womb."

[MSG$01FE6E,24]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$01FEA0,50]
Spurt! Splat! Splat!

[MSG$01FEDF,47]
I continue to come. It's like I'm taking a piss.

[MSG$01FF1B,82]
I continue to spray cum from my dick. Kitami's vagina wrings out every last drop of semen

[MSG$01FF72,29]
|pooled inside me.

[MSG$01FF9C,34]
Kitami "Oh, my, you're still coming."

[MSG$01FFD8,78]
Kitami "You're my servant now. All right, I'm going to grant you the power I promised you."

[MSG$020040,92]
Kitami "You're still too inexperienced to have a high-level spirit serve you. So I'm going to give you my own demon-servant, an Imp."

[MSG$0200B6,44]
Kitami "This is Rasha the Imp. Accept him now."

[MSG$0200FC,59]
Kitami's voice cuts through the haze in my mind.

[MSG$02013C,67]
I still haven't stopped coming, and I'm convulsing and shivering from the pleasure...

[MSG$02018C,52]
Kitami "Sign this contract with me. Swear that you'll be loyal, and will bring me pleasure..."

[MSG$0201DA,61]
As she chants, she pushes her long nails against me.

[MSG$020224,55]
Her sharp nails dig into my flesh, and draw blood...

[MSG$020268,59]
And she scratches my body with her nails as she moves her hands.

[MSG$0202A8,33]
I twist my body from the pain and pleasure.

[MSG$02035F,43]
When she's left a triangular mark on my body, she removes her hands.

[MSG$02038F,55]
Blood is dripping from the scratches onto the floor...

[MSG$0203D3,88]
Kitami "That finalizes our contract. You've signed a contract with me. From now on, my demon-servant Rasha

[MSG$020430,23]
|will lend you his power."

[MSG$020461,78]
Kitami "He's a kind of incubus, highly skilled in the art of lust. As a man, I'm sure you'll find a lot of use for him, won't you?"

[MSG$0204C9,47]
As she whispers, she slowly stands up.

[MSG$020505,83]
My dick, covered in my own cum, slides out, popping out of her vagina.

[MSG$02055D,53]
Now that it's been extricated, my prick is still exuding semen.

[MSG$02059F,67]
Kitami "Looks like you were aroused big time. That makes me happy."

[MSG$0205FC,91]
When she stands up, a stream of cum pours out of her crevice.

[MSG$02065C,61]
It drips down her thighs and pools on the floor.

[MSG$0206A6,43]
Minase "(breathing heavily)"

[MSG$0206EB,64]
Kitami "The day is drawing near...I've got all the players, now all I have to do is wait."

[MSG$020745,77]
Kitami "But first of all, we need to get rid of those annoying flies...it will be a good way to kill time,

[MSG$020797,23]
at least..."

[MSG$0207C8,39]
Kitami "I'm counting on you, Minase..."

[MSG$020809,103]
I've finally been released from my mad pleasure, and slip into unconsciousness as she speaks.

[MSG$02090D,12]
..................

[MSG$020926,8]
............

[MSG$02093B,4]
......

[MSG$020957,19]
Minase "I won't do it."

[MSG$020984,29]
I reject her request.

[MSG$0209AE,67]
What she's asking me to do is to basically become her servant.

[MSG$0209FE,91]
I don't know what she has in mind, but I have no desire to be at Kitami's beck and call.

[MSG$020A66,59]
I can sense that it would be dangerous to believe Kitami, who just appeared out of thin air.

[MSG$020AA6,57]
I've never been able to trust her anyway, for some reason...

[MSG$020AEC,30]
Kitami "Why? Why are you turning me down?"

[MSG$020B24,64]
Minase "Don't you think it's a little too much to ask me to believe a story like that?"

[MSG$020B7E,41]
Minase "I don't know anything about you."

[MSG$020BC1,27]
Kitami "Are you scared?"

[MSG$020BF6,19]
Minase "..."

[MSG$020C16,29]
Kitami "Don't worry, you can trust me."

[MSG$020C4D,45]
Kitami "I'm the kind of person you need right now."

[MSG$020C94,83]
Kitami "You've already taken a bite out of the Forbidden Fruit. Sinners like you should be in a world

[MSG$020CEC,25]
|for sinners."

[MSG$020D1F,50]
With that, she takes a step towards me. Instinctively I step back.

[MSG$020D5E,75]
She stares right at me, and I'm overcome by a feeling that she's sucking me right into her eyes.

[MSG$020DAE,28]
It's no good...I can't escape...

[MSG$020DD7,61]
Kitami "Do you want to get to know me? Then I'll tell you everything..."

[MSG$020E2E,89]
After she says this, she reaches out and puts her hand on my crotch, massaging her way up until she's holding my prick in her hand.

[MSG$020E94,19]
Minase "Ah..."

[MSG$020EC1,43]
Kitami "Now then, let's you and I fall together..."

[MSG$020F70,24]
Minase "Stop it!"

[MSG$02103B,51]
Suddenly I push Kitami away, freeing myself from her curse.

[MSG$02107B,67]
Minase "I'm not gonna be your slave! Go find someone else!"

[MSG$0210D8,39]
I tell her this in no uncertain terms.

[MSG$02110C,45]
The last thing I want to do is fall into hell with this professor.

[MSG$02113E,46]
Besides, I haven't sunk to that level yet.

[MSG$0211AB,15]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$0211C7,69]
Kitami stares at me coldly, not moving a muscle the whole time.

[MSG$021211,45]
After a silence, Kitami speaks in a flat voice.

[MSG$02124B,30]
Her eyes are gleaming so coldly that it makes my skin crawl.

[MSG$021283,59]
Kitami "And I had such high expectations of you...you've thrown me in despair."

[MSG$0212CB,52]
There's no longer any trace in her voice of the professor that she supposedly is.

[MSG$021319,53]
If Kitami really does possess the Dark Power, then I'm no match for her.

[MSG$02135B,71]
No one knows the magnitude of that power better than me...

[MSG$0213A7,33]
Minase "..."

[MSG$0213E0,19]
I can't trust this professor after all.

[MSG$021400,45]
I ignore her and walk toward the door.

[MSG$021432,39]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$021498,15]
Kitami stares at me coldly, not moving a muscle the whole time.

[MSG$0214B4,69]
The moment I stretch my hand out toward the knob, she speaks out in a flat voice.

[MSG$0214FE,59]
Kitami "I see...what a pity."

[MSG$021546,30]
Her eyes are gleaming so coldly that it makes my skin crawl.

[MSG$02157E,59]
Kitami "And I had such high expectations of you...you've thrown me in despair."

[MSG$0215C6,52]
There's no longer any trace in her voice of the professor that she supposedly is.

[MSG$021614,53]
If Kitami really does possess the Dark Power, then I'm no match for her.

[MSG$021656,71]
No one knows the magnitude of that power better than me...

[MSG$0216A2,33]
Kitami "But the thing is, I can always find someone to take your place."

[MSG$0216D0,55]
I realize that Kitami is creeping closer and closer to me. I impulsively open the Book of Magic.

[MSG$021721,75]
I desperately search for a spell that will protect me.

[MSG$021779,61]
But the more frantic I get, the harder it is to turn the pages.

[MSG$0217BB,47]
Kitami "That won't do you any good. The spells in that book will only have a temporary effect on me."

[MSG$0217F7,76]
When I hear this, I stop turning pages and stare at Kitami.

[MSG$02185D,59]
Minase "What do you want from me?"

[MSG$0218A5,32]
Kitami "I've changed my mind, see..."

[MSG$0218DF,25]
Kitami "I wasn't planning to kill you, but now I have the urge to abuse you."

[MSG$021912,77]
So saying, Kitami leers at me.

[MSG$021979,31]
Minase "(Gulps)"

[MSG$0219A5,20]
I threaten her with the sword in my hand.

[MSG$0219D3,53]
Minase "Stay away from me!"

[MSG$021A15,20]
Kitami is unmoved by the flickering light reflecting off the blade.

[MSG$021A43,47]
All of a sudden, the sword doesn't seem like a lethal weapon at all.

[MSG$021A77,53]
Kitami "Don't worry, now...I'm very good at necromancy."

[MSG$021AB9,52]
Kitami "Your physical body will become a vessel that does my bidding. I'll keep you as a pet for a while."

[MSG$021B07,86]
Minase "Don't screw with me!"

[MSG$021B77,24]
I wave the sword around wildly.

[MSG$021BA9,35]
Whoosh! Whoosh!

[MSG$021BD9,26]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$021C00,19]
Kitami doesn't even flinch. She's so relaxed she has a smile on her lips.

[MSG$021C20,67]
I'm so terrified that I bring the sword down across her body.

[MSG$021C70,53]
Clang!

[MSG$021D4B,16]
But just before it hits her, it's seemingly deflected by some unseen wall, and

[MSG$021D68,88]
plunges into the floor with a clang.

[MSG$021DC5,27]
Minase "No way!"

[MSG$021DED,22]
Kitami "(laughs)"

[MSG$021E1D,27]
Kitami "(laughs)"

[MSG$021E52,34]
I'm stunned. I can hear Kitami's mocking laughter echoing all over the room.

[MSG$021E8F,65]
Kitami "Idiot. Did you really think you could actually hurt me, you fool?"

[MSG$021EDD,59]
Kitami "I'll just send you off to lament your stupidity in hell!"

[MSG$021F32,57]
Hearing this, I try to make a run for it.

[MSG$021F85,53]
Kitami's dead serious. Plus this woman's got the power to do exactly what she said she'd do.

[MSG$021FBF,60]
Minase "!!"

[MSG$022008,16]
Minase "Holy shit!"

[MSG$022025,28]
That's when I discover that I can't move. It's like my body is frozen.

[MSG$02205B,75]
No matter how hard I try to move forward, I don't budge an inch.

[MSG$0220AB,45]
Kitami "It's no use. You can't escape now."

[MSG$0220E5,44]
With that, Kitami looks down at her feet.

[MSG$02212B,37]
I follow her gaze...

[MSG$022155,23]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$022179,14]
I can see my own shadow, created by the light of the candles. Kitami has planted her feet on it.

[MSG$022194,75]
But surely that's not why I'm immobile?

[MSG$0221E4,26]
Kitami "Now then, how should I play with you?"

[MSG$02220B,53]
Kitami slowly approaches me, stepping over my shadow.

[MSG$02225A,49]
Kitami "If I give you any visible bruises, it'll only be a hassle later..."

[MSG$022298,41]
Kitami "I've got it...why don't I be merciful and send you to the heights of ecstasy? Then you can go mad and die!"

[MSG$0222DB,73]
With that, Kitami takes some kind of capsule from her pocket.

[MSG$02233E,61]
Kitami "You're going to have an orgasm so powerful it's going to kill you. Ha ha ha!"

[MSG$022388,68]
Kitami "You're a strong boy, I'm sure the effects will be monstrous."

[MSG$0223E6,61]
Minase "What the hell are you gonna do?"

[MSG$02243D,32]
She shows me the capsule in her hand in reply.

[MSG$022477,47]
Kitami "This is a secret potion that will teach you about lust. In other words, it's an aphrodisiac."

[MSG$0224B3,50]
Kitami "It's something I concocted by blending magic and modern medicine. Its efficacy is guaranteed."

[MSG$0224FF,73]
Kitami "This is more than 10 times the normal dose. A special maximum-strength version..."

[MSG$022562,78]
Kitami "As a service to you, I'm giving you a super-concentrated dosage.

[MSG$0225CA,84]
This would drive even an elephant to madness in an instant."

[MSG$022638,56]
Minase "Are you fucking crazy? No way am I taking that thing!"

[MSG$02268A,82]
Kitami "Oh yes you are...struggle all you want, but there's nothing you can do to get away."

[MSG$022799,77]
With that, Kitami places the capsule between her lips, then lays her mouth over mine.

[MSG$0227EB,71]
I can't move. I'm helpless against her advances.

[MSG$02283F,25]
Kitami "Mmmm..."

[MSG$022872,44]
Minase "Mmmm! Mmmm!"

[MSG$0228B8,22]
Spurt, splat...

[MSG$0228DB,50]
Kitami's tongue forces its way between my lips,

[MSG$022912,49]
and begins to shove the capsule toward the back of my throat.

[MSG$022950,17]
Kitami "Mmmm..."

[MSG$02297B,21]
Minase "(gagging)"

[MSG$0229AA,90]
Desperately I try to keep from swallowing the capsule. But Kitami's tongue is too skilful. Eventually she manages to force

[MSG$022A09,47]
|the capsule, covered in both our saliva, towards the back of my throat.

[MSG$022A45,10]
Gulp...

[MSG$022AD5,46]
Minase "Ugh...ugh...ugh..."

[MSG$022B1D,25]
Kitami withdraws her tongue from my mouth.

[MSG$022B3B,49]
A long sticky thread of saliva dangles between us.

[MSG$022B79,23]
Dammit, I swallowed that thing.

[MSG$022B9D,76]
Kitami "You're history. The capsule will melt instantly. You'll just have to give it up."

[MSG$022C03,34]
Minase "What's going to happen now?"

[MSG$022C3F,56]
Kitami "Who knows? I've never used that amount on a human before."

[MSG$022C91,66]
Kitami "Don't worry, you'll find out soon enough. First-hand, that is."

[MSG$022CED,80]
Kitami "Just for your reference, when I gave another student 1/10 the amount you just swallowed,

[MSG$022D42,21]
he couldn't stop masturbating. He just jerked off until he lost consciousness."

[MSG$022D71,85]
Kitami "Well, let's just say that even if you do survive this, it's highly unlikely that you'll still have your sanity."

[MSG$022DE0,21]
Minase "Are you serious?"

[MSG$022EAF,77]
All I can do is stare dumbly at Kitami as she speaks in that calm tone of voice, a little smile on her lips.

[MSG$022F09,22]
Minase "Ugh!"

[MSG$022F39,37]
Soon after, I begin to feel a change inside my body.

[MSG$022F6B,41]
Kitami "It looks like the medicine's kicking in already."

[MSG$022FAE,14]
Slam!

[MSG$023021,20]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$02304F,43]
My body's being taken over by a massive shock.

[MSG$02307F,50]
Lust for pleasure...it's setting my mind on fire.

[MSG$0230BE,43]
Minase "Augh! (heavy breathing)"

[MSG$023103,22]
Kitami "Do you feel ill?"

[MSG$023133,56]
Kitami "Do you want me to help you? Or would you rather give yourself some comfort?"

[MSG$023185,26]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$0231B9,35]
Desperately I try to fight off the sensation.

[MSG$0231E1,35]
But I soon realize it's useless.

[MSG$023211,67]
No matter how hard I try to reject it, my lust only grows stronger.

[MSG$023261,32]
Thump...thump...thump...

[MSG$02328E,67]
Every time my heart beats, I can feel the quivering in my crotch.

[MSG$0232D6,62]
I can't hold back anymore. If I resist any longer I'll go crazy.

[MSG$023321,25]
Minase "Help...help me!

[MSG$023354,84]
Finally I give in. I'm at the point where I don't care what happens to me anymore, as long as she satisfies my lust.

[MSG$0233B5,40]
Kitami "All right, I will. I'll give you some relief right away."

[MSG$023474,71]
Kitami takes off my pants, and whips out my erect prick.

[MSG$0234C8,40]
Kitami "My goodness. Looks like you'll come with just one squeeze."

[MSG$02350B,35]
Kitami "Let's see...why don't I do you with my breasts?"

[MSG$0235C4,47]
Kitami exposes her huge breasts to me.

[MSG$023600,37]
Kitami "All right, just stick it between these."

[MSG$0236C8,63]
I succumb to her tempting words and plunge my cock between her boobs.

[MSG$023714,67]
They're so big that there's still plenty of room, even after she envelops my prick.

[MSG$023764,65]
She pushes her boobs from both sides, and squeezes my prick.

[MSG$0237AA,59]
I can't take it. I start trying to move around in my narrow confines.

[MSG$0237F2,72]
Kitami "Impatient boy...Your prick is so hot it feels like it's on fire!"

[MSG$023854,38]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$023887,69]
The juice from my prick dampens her boobs. Already I can hear squishing sounds between them..

[MSG$0238D1,83]
Kitami's boobs are surprisingly soft, and partly because of the potion, I'm ready to come in no time.

[MSG$023931,68]
Kitami "You're about to come, aren't you? That's all right, just spray it out whenever you feel like it."

[MSG$02398F,81]
Desperately I try to hold back, but I can't. It has a life of its own.

[MSG$0239E5,51]
Kitami squeezes me even harder, stimulating me even more.

[MSG$023A25,34]
Squish...squish...squish...

[MSG$023A54,32]
Minase "I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!"

[MSG$023A8E,37]
Kitami "Go ahead, come all you want."

[MSG$023ACD,30]
Minase "Whoa!"

[MSG$023B05,69]
The pleasure I feel is intense as I stop grinding my hips and climax in Kitami's breasts.

[MSG$023C49,48]
Spurt! Spurt! Spurt!

[MSG$023C86,35]
Kitami "Well! You sure are coming big time!"

[MSG$023CC3,63]
The white juice spurts out from between her huge boobs, and soils her face.

[MSG$023D07,80]
My brain is stimulated by my intense pleasure, I'm so turned on that I know I'll faint

[MSG$023D5C,13]
|if I lose focus. My whole body shakes.

[MSG$023D76,38]
Throb...squirm...twitch...

[MSG$023DA9,91]
I continue to shoot off for a long time. The cum overflows from her cleavage and drips down onto the floor.

[MSG$023E11,56]
Kitami "If you've got this much cum to show for it, you must've really enjoyed it!"

[MSG$023E63,56]
Kitami "You'd better savor it while you can. This is your last time..."

[MSG$023EB5,82]
Normally, I'd be finished by now, but my prick continues to produce a massive spray of frothy

[MSG$023F0C,13]
|cum.

[MSG$023F26,35]
This is weird...something's definitely up with this.

[MSG$023F56,20]
Minase "Ugh..."

[MSG$023FFD,44]
Spurt...spurt...spurt...

[MSG$0240AF,45]
Minase "I can't stop! I can't stop..."

[MSG$0240F6,33]
The pleasure still hasn't worn off, either.

[MSG$02411C,63]
It's making me feel like my brain's going to melt, and inwardly I'm screaming for it to be over.

[MSG$024168,71]
Kitami "It's no good. It's not going to stop until your heart stops."

[MSG$0241C9,90]
Kitami "Which will break down first, your brain or your heart? Not that it really makes much difference anyway..."

[MSG$02423D,75]
Speaking calmly, Kitami pushes me away and wipes away the cum that's soiled her. She puts on her clothes and stands.

[MSG$024337,25]
Minase "Help...help me!"

[MSG$02436A,82]
Kitami "All right, I'm going to get going now. I don't have time to watch you in this pathetic state."

[MSG$0243D6,25]
Minase "Wait!"

[MSG$024409,94]
Kitami "You're lucky, getting to die in a state of ecstasy. Not many people get to die so happy."

[MSG$024481,45]
Minase "No! I don't want to die! Augh..."

[MSG$0244C8,33]
Kitami "Good night..."

[MSG$024527,26]
Squeak...

[MSG$02454E,12]
Slam...

[MSG$024567,43]
Kitami abandons me there, leaving the room.

[MSG$024597,37]
I start to lose consciousness...

[MSG$024659,27]
It's too late now for regrets.

[MSG$024679,47]
The price to pay for underestimating the power of the Dark Arts was too high...

[MSG$0246B5,71]
I beg of thee, O great and merciful God, take pity on us, and forgive us for our sins...

[MSG$024729,30]
Ending No. 5 ''Reika Kitami''

[MSG$02474C,15]
...Bad End

[MSG$024792,50]
Kitami "But do you really think you can come back from where you are?"

[MSG$0247DE,47]
Kitami "I can always find someone else to take your place..."

[MSG$024827,49]
I realize that Kitami is creeping closer and closer to me.

[MSG$024865,74]
Kitami "You've already taken a bite out of the Forbidden Fruit. There's a high price to pay for that."

[MSG$0248C9,39]
I impulsively open the Book of Magic.

[MSG$0248F5,61]
I desperately search for a spell that will protect me.

[MSG$024937,47]
But the more frantic I get, the harder it is to turn the pages.

[MSG$024973,78]
Kitami "That won't do you any good. The spells in that book will only have a temporary effect on me."

[MSG$0249DB,59]
When I hear this, I stop turning pages and stare at Kitami.

[MSG$024A23,23]
Kitami "It's time to give it up."

[MSG$024A54,71]
I keep backing up, trying with all my might to come up with a way to get out of here.

[MSG$024AA8,50]
Kitami "It won't do you any good to try to escape. Now come here."

[MSG$024AF4,71]
Then I notice something odd; the fact that Kitami is still standing outside the magic circle.

[MSG$024B40,76]
She's not even trying to enter...It's like she can't come in...

[MSG$024B99,62]
That's it, she can't come in. Because of the magic circle...

[MSG$024BDC,81]
Magic circles are drawn to protect magicians from evil. And I've just sanctified this particular magic circle

[MSG$024C32,21]
|myself.

[MSG$024C54,84]
It probably wouldn't have any effect on a normal person, but if Kitami is affiliated with the devil,

[MSG$024CAD,39]
then the effects of the magic circle should kick in.

[MSG$024CE1,63]
In other words, as long as I stay inside the circle she can't do anything to me.

[MSG$024DB0,37]
Minase "I get it, so that's it, huh?"

[MSG$024DEF,42]
Kitami "What's the matter, have you decided to give in?"

[MSG$024E33,29]
Minase "No, the opposite, actually."

[MSG$024E6A,55]
Minase "You can't step into this magic circle."

[MSG$024EBB,17]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$024ED9,32]
Minase "Hey, what do you have to say about that?"

[MSG$024F13,39]
Minase "Come on, try coming into the circle."

[MSG$024F54,49]
Slowly, she stretches her hand out toward me.

[MSG$0250A7,14]
Thwack!

[MSG$0250C2,17]
Kitami "Damn..."

[MSG$0250ED,91]
The instant she tried to put her hand over the line of magic circle, something deflected it.

[MSG$02514D,17]
So it's working after all.

[MSG$02516B,60]
Minase "Just as I thought...you can't enter this circle."

[MSG$0251C1,19]
Kitami "..."

[MSG$0251E1,83]
Minase "You might have all the power in the world, but a simple circle drawn on the floor can render you totally helpless."

[MSG$02524E,37]
I sneer at her as I say this.

[MSG$025278,53]
As long as I stay inside the circle, at least she won't be able to hurt me.

[MSG$0252BA,29]
Kitami "I wouldn't be too sure of that..."

[MSG$0252F1,18]
Minase "Huh?"

[MSG$02531D,62]
Kitami "Do you really think you can resist me in that magic circle?"

[MSG$025375,97]
Kitami "Don't forget, during ritual 12 years ago, this magic circle was too weak to escape the power..."

[MSG$0253F0,45]
With that, she reaches out her hand toward me again.

[MSG$02553F,28]
Whack! Crackle...

[MSG$025568,41]
Her hand touches the barrier field, and bluish-white sparks fly.

[MSG$02559E,54]
Kitami "OKTNS ITRPS TUER OILIF

[MSG$0255D9,39]
|TUER IRTAP EYROLG"

[MSG$02561A,55]
As Kitami chants, the barrier field begins to flicker.

[MSG$02565E,22]
Minase "What?!"

[MSG$02568E,57]
Kitami's hand continues to consume the barrier field, pushing its way inside.

[MSG$0256CC,37]
It's just a matter of time before the barrier field is breached.

[MSG$0256FE,42]
Kitami "So do you still believe in the power of the magic circle?"

[MSG$025742,18]
Minase "Shit!"

[MSG$02576E,60]
I've got to escape...if the barrier field's breached, I won't have any protection at all.

[MSG$0257AF,23]
I don't have time to hesitate.

[MSG$0257D3,26]
Minase "Out of my way!"

[MSG$025807,69]
As I shout, I throw the Book of Magic in Kitami's face as hard as I can.

[MSG$025859,12]
Crash!

[MSG$025872,61]
The book is considerably heavy. I can hear a rush of wind as it flies towards her face.

[MSG$0258B4,37]
In the next instant, I make a rush toward the door.

[MSG$02597E,8]
Slam!

[MSG$025993,18]
Kitami "Ugh!"

[MSG$025A3C,96]
The book hits Kitami's face with a thump. She strikes it away with her hand, but the shock of the impact makes her off balance for an instant.

[MSG$025AA9,71]
Ignoring her, I kick the door open, race up the stairs and burst into the hallway.

[MSG$025B7B,10]
Slam!

[MSG$025B92,57]
I close the door right away. I gulp air as though I'm trying to calm down my breathing.

[MSG$025BD8,41]
Minase "Gasp...gasp...gasp..."

[MSG$025C1B,98]
Kitami isn't chasing me. There are a few students in the hall, staring at me.

[MSG$025C92,76]
Somehow I managed to escape. But is Kitami really going to let me go?

[MSG$025CEB,92]
I know that would be too good to be true, but even Kitami wouldn't attack me in front of other people...

[MSG$025D86,38]
Saeki "What are you doing...in a place like this?"

[MSG$025DC6,63]
Saeki sees me standing their catching my breath as she passes by.

[MSG$025E0A,41]
What's she still doing here at school?

[MSG$025E40,29]
Minase "Nothing, it's nothing."

[MSG$025E77,55]
Saeki "Are you all right? You look pale. Why don't you go to the campus infirmary?"

[MSG$025EC8,47]
I was going to go there anyway.

[MSG$025F04,23]
Minase "It's nothing, I'm fine."

[MSG$025F35,17]
Saeki "..."

[MSG$025F53,81]
With that, I head toward the infirmary where Imari is sleeping. My footsteps are heavy as I walk down the hall.

[MSG$025FB1,16]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$026040,10]
Door opens

[MSG$026057,39]
I return to the infirmary and check on Imari in bed.

[MSG$026107,47]
Imari "Zzz...zzz..."

[MSG$026150,31]
Imari's still asleep.

[MSG$02617C,47]
Imari "Zzz...zzz..."

[MSG$0261C5,55]
I stare at Imari as she lies there sleeping peacefully.

[MSG$026201,45]
The sight of her sleeping face puts my mind at ease.

[MSG$02623B,29]
I shouldn't stay here long.

[MSG$026265,90]
Right now I need to avoid that crazy professor as much as possible. I'd better wake Imari up and get out of here.

[MSG$0262CC,32]
Minase "Imari...hey, wake up!"

[MSG$026306,16]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$026323,27]
I shake Imari.

[MSG$02634B,21]
Imari "Mmm..."

[MSG$02637A,51]
Imari twists her body and starts to regain consciousness.

[MSG$0263B2,45]
I can't believe she can sleep so deeply after what happened.

[MSG$0263EC,31]
Imari "Mmm...mmm..."

[MSG$026425,27]
Imari "Huh...Minase?"

[MSG$0264D6,12]
Getting up

[MSG$0264EF,31]
Imari slowly wakes up.

[MSG$02651B,62]
Imari "Mmm...huh? Hey, what am I doing here?"

[MSG$026573,63]
She rubs her eyes and looks around.

[MSG$0265BF,9]
Whoa...

[MSG$0265D5,27]
Imari's not wearing any clothes.

[MSG$0265F5,21]
Her underwear is blindingly white...

[MSG$026617,62]
Imari "Wait, now I remember! That jerk Shinjou or whatever his name was, he..."

[MSG$02666F,74]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$0266D3,47]
Imari's trembling from rage as she remembers what went down on the rooftop.

[MSG$02670F,53]
It looks like she doesn't remember anything that happened after she lost consciousness.

[MSG$026749,59]
I'm glad, because it would complicate things if she remembered what happened in the gym.

[MSG$026791,69]
Imari "Oh, no, look at the time! The club meeting's over by now!"

[MSG$0267F0,47]
Imari "Huh? What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?"

[MSG$026839,49]
Imari notices that I'm staring at her and looks down.

[MSG$026877,19]
Minase "That..."

[MSG$0268A4,27]
I point to Imari's bra.

[MSG$0268CC,18]
Imari "Huh?"

[MSG$0268F8,21]
Imari "..."

[MSG$02691A,35]
Imari looks down at her body for the first time.

[MSG$0269C7,68]
Imari "Augh! Don't look at me! Why am I naked?"

[MSG$026A25,20]
Imari "Don't tell me..."

[MSG$026A53,29]
Imari stares at me.

[MSG$026A75,35]
As if I'm the culprit.

[MSG$026AA5,33]
Minase "It wasn't me! That's a false accusation!"

[MSG$026AE0,25]
Imari "I don't know about that..."

[MSG$026B13,27]
I'm being wrongly accused.

[MSG$026B33,69]
Anyway, Kitami didn't have to take off all her clothes. Was she just being mean?

[MSG$026B85,62]
Imari "Stop staring at me, already! Turn around for heaven's sake!"

[MSG$026BDD,43]
I hurriedly turn my back on Imari.

[MSG$026C15,20]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$026D18,10]
Click

[MSG$026D2F,25]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$026D62,37]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$026D94,86]
Imari had vented her anger against Inoue and his gang all the way home, but

[MSG$026DEF,35]
I barely heard her, only giving her vague responses from time to time.

[MSG$026E1F,47]
Right now, I don't have time to listen to her rant.

[MSG$026ED7,27]
I sit down at my desk and open my bag.

[MSG$026EF7,35]
The Book of Magic is no longer there...

[MSG$026F27,27]
I'd thrown it against Kitami's face.

[MSG$026F47,70]
I have some regrets about losing that book. But there was nothing else I could've done...

[MSG$026F9A,45]
Besides, that book would only hinder me if I tried to escape from Kitami.

[MSG$026FCC,84]
Now I have no connection to the basement room. As time goes on, I bet Kitami will forget about me...

[MSG$02702D,21]
Minase "(yawns)"

[MSG$02705C,23]
I'm really wiped out today.

[MSG$027078,39]
If I get into bed, I'll fall asleep within three seconds.

[MSG$0270AC,15]
You can't blame me, really...

[MSG$0270C0,47]
Too much happened to me today.

[MSG$0270FC,45]
I get up from my chair and tear off my clothes...

[MSG$02712E,65]
I leave my sister a note, telling her I don't need dinner, and then I dive into bed.

[MSG$02717C,35]
Minase "I can't tell what's true and what's not..."

[MSG$0271B9,41]
I remember Kitami's words.

[MSG$0271E7,51]
Kitami...a demon-master who took part in that ritual 12 years ago.

[MSG$027227,77]
But can that be true? It's odd that she's the only one who survived. And if you go by what Kitami told me,

[MSG$027279,23]
the story doesn't add up...

[MSG$02729D,47]
But pondering all this won't get me any answers.

[MSG$0272D1,69]
I have too much to think about. I don't even know what I have to straighten out first.

[MSG$027323,59]
I soon as I lose concentration, I sink into sleep...

[MSG$0273E6,12]
..................

[MSG$0273FF,8]
............

[MSG$027414,4]
......

[MSG$02742C,16]
April 24 - Home

[MSG$02743D,23]
Voice "Wake up..."

[MSG$02746E,35]
Voice "Come on, I said wake up!"

[MSG$0274AB,26]
Rustle, rustle, rustle...

[MSG$027562,25]
Minase "Mmm..."

[MSG$027595,42]
Imari "So you're not going to get up, eh? All right, then..."

[MSG$0275D9,51]
I hear her rustling around, then she places something in my ears.

[MSG$027619,29]
Imari "Sss...."

[MSG$027650,42]
Imari "Wake the heck up!"

[MSG$027694,22]
Minase "Augh!"

[MSG$0276C4,31]
Instantly I jump out of bed.

[MSG$0276E8,81]
I've got a stethoscope against my ears, and Imari's holding the end of it like a microphone.

[MSG$0277E5,40]
Imari "Come on, how long is it going to take you to get up?"

[MSG$027827,26]
Minase "Is it morning?"

[MSG$02785B,49]
I yawn as I ask Imari this. She's standing next to me.

[MSG$027899,39]
Imari "Are you still dreaming or what?"

[MSG$0278DA,55]
True, this doesn't look like my room...

[MSG$02791E,27]
And I'm in my uniform.

[MSG$02793E,31]
There's a faint hospital smell, too..

[MSG$027962,19]
Is this the school infirmary?

[MSG$027982,68]
Imari "There's nothing strange about me being asleep here, but why were you sleeping next to me?"

[MSG$0279E0,24]
I wonder why?

[MSG$0279FD,53]
I remember getting roughed up by Inoue and the gang on the roof. Then I went to the basement...

[MSG$027A37,21]
And after that, I remember...

[MSG$027A59,78]
Imari "What time do you think it is? The club meeting ended a while ago."

[MSG$027AC1,69]
I glance at my watch and see that it's the end of the day..

[MSG$027B0B,51]
A lot of time has gone by since I was in the basement...

[MSG$027B4B,9]
Basement...

[MSG$027B61,30]
That's right...I was in the basement and...

[MSG$027B8C,15]
I remember everything,

[MSG$027BA0,23]
What happened in the basement...

[MSG$027BBF,30]
Kitami and I...

[MSG$027BE2,30]
Could that have been a dream?

[MSG$027C0D,36]
Imari "What's the matter? You look so lost."

[MSG$027C4B,32]
Minase "Huh? Oh, it's nothing."

[MSG$027C85,30]
Minase "Listen, where's Kitami?"

[MSG$027CBD,68]
Imari "How should I know? Nobody was around when I woke up."

[MSG$027D1B,19]
Minase "Oh..."

[MSG$027D48,43]
I don't know how long I've been here, either.

[MSG$027D78,43]
It feels like it all happened in a dream.

[MSG$027DB0,58]
Imari "Anyway, let's go home. Or else the gate will close on us."

[MSG$027E04,23]
Minase "Yeah, you're right..."

[MSG$027E35,41]
I give up trying to figure it out, and get up from bed.

[MSG$027E6B,24]
Minase "Are you all right?"

[MSG$027E9D,47]
I ask Imari this as I extricate myself from the bed.

[MSG$027ED9,39]
Imari "Yes, I slept soundly so I'm fine now."

[MSG$027F4C,82]
Imari "Grr! I'm so mad he beat me! Next time I see him I'm going to kick his butt!"

[MSG$027FB8,67]
Imari's totally unfazed, as if nothing had happened.

[MSG$028000,72]
She's just her usual self. I can't believe how thick-skinned she is.

[MSG$028079,10]
Thud...

[MSG$028090,51]
As soon as my feet hit the ground, something falls to the floor.

[MSG$0280D0,45]
I look and it's something wrapped in white cloth.

[MSG$02810A,11]
The Book of Magic...

[MSG$02811A,52]
I pick it up in a hurry. I don't remember bringing that with me...

[MSG$02815B,39]
When I stand up, I'm overcome by fatigue.

[MSG$028187,21]
My body feels super-heavy.

[MSG$0281DB,22]
Imari "What's wrong?"

[MSG$02820B,27]
Minase "It's nothing."

[MSG$028240,29]
I shake my head to get rid of it.

[MSG$02826A,49]
My stomach hurts.

[MSG$0282A0,51]
I touch it and it tingles painfully.

[MSG$0282D8,35]
I pull up my shirt to have a look.

[MSG$028308,14]
Minase "!?"

[MSG$028323,39]
There's a bloody triangle on my shirt.

[MSG$02834F,63]
It's like a diagram drawn in blood on my shirt.

[MSG$02839B,13]
The symbol of the contract...

[MSG$0283AD,29]
It was Kitami who drew it...

[MSG$0283D7,57]
In that case, everything that happened in that basement was for real.

[MSG$028415,47]
I quickly conceal it from Imari.

[MSG$028451,17]
Imari "Let's go."

[MSG$02847C,61]
I pick up the cloth-wrapped book, and leave the infirmary with Imari.

[MSG$0284C6,20]
April 24 - Night/Home

[MSG$0285C9,10]
Click

[MSG$0285E0,25]
Minase "I'm home."

[MSG$028613,37]
I call out as I stumble inside my house.

[MSG$028645,86]
Imari had vented all her anger against Inoue and his gang all the way home, but

[MSG$0286A0,35]
I barely heard her, only giving her vague responses from time to time.

[MSG$0286D0,47]
Right now, I don't have time to listen to her rant.

[MSG$028788,27]
I sit down at my desk and open my bag.

[MSG$0287A8,49]
I take out the Book of Magic and set it on my desk.

[MSG$0287E6,60]
I remember bringing this down to the basement. And then I had sex with Kitami...

[MSG$02882F,78]
When I close my eyes, it comes back to me. My body still remembers how it felt.

[MSG$02888A,21]
Minase "(yawns)"

[MSG$0288B9,23]
I'm really wiped out today.

[MSG$0288D5,39]
If I get into bed, I'll fall asleep within three seconds.

[MSG$028909,15]
You can't blame me, really...

[MSG$02891D,39]
Not after what happened in that basement.

[MSG$028951,45]
I get up from my chair and tear off my clothes.

[MSG$028983,65]
I leave my sister a note, telling her I don't need dinner, and then I dive into bed.

[MSG$0289D1,35]
Minase "I can't tell what's true and what's not..."

[MSG$028A0E,41]
I remember Kitami's words.

[MSG$028A44,51]
Kitami...a demon-master who took part in that ritual 12 years ago.

[MSG$028A84,77]
But can that be true? It's odd that she's the only one who survived. And if you go by what Kitami told me,

[MSG$028AD6,23]
the story doesn't add up...

[MSG$028AFA,47]
But pondering all this won't get me any answers.

[MSG$028B2E,69]
I have too much to think about. I don't even know what I should straighten out first.

[MSG$028B80,59]
I soon as I lose concentration, I sink into sleep...
